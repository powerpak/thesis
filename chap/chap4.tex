\chapter{Estimating local costs of \emph{Clostridium difficile} infection using statistical learning and electronic medical records}
\label{chap:cdi_cost}

\begin{quote}
\emph{Reported per-patient costs of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) vary by two orders of magnitude among different hospitals, suggesting that precise, local analyses are needed to guide decision-making. We sought to estimate changes in length of stay (LOS) associated with CDI at one hospital using only automatically extractable electronic medical record (EMR) data. Retrospective cohort study of 171,938 visit records spanning a 7-year period. 23,968 variables were extracted from EMR data recorded within 24 hours of each admission to train an elastic net regularized logistic regression model for propensity score matching. To address time-dependent bias (reverse causation), we stratified comparisons by time-of-infection and fit multistate models. The estimated difference in median LOS for propensity-matched cohorts varied from 3.1 days (95\% CI, 2.2–3.9) to 10.1 days (95\% CI, 7.3–12.2) depending on the case definition; however, dependency of the estimate on time-to-infection was observed. Stratification by time to first positive toxin assay, excluding probable community-acquired infections, showed a minimum excess LOS of 3.1 days (95\% CI, 1.7–4.4). Under the same case definition, the multistate model averaged an excess LOS of 3.3 days (95\% CI, 2.6–4.0). Changes in LOS can be extrapolated to a marginal dollar cost per CDI case by multiplying by the average cost of an inpatient-day. Infection control officers can leverage automatically extractable EMR data to estimate costs of CDI at their specific institution.
