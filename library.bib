abstract = {BACKGROUND The control of Clostridium difficile infections is an international clinical challenge. The incidence of C difficile in England declined by roughly 80{\%} after 2006, following the implementation of national control policies; we tested two hypotheses to investigate their role in this decline. First, if C difficile infection declines in England were driven by reductions in use of particular antibiotics, then incidence of C difficile infections caused by resistant isolates should decline faster than that caused by susceptible isolates across multiple genotypes. Second, if C difficile infection declines were driven by improvements in hospital infection control, then transmitted (secondary) cases should decline regardless of susceptibility. METHODS Regional (Oxfordshire and Leeds, UK) and national data for the incidence of C difficile infections and antimicrobial prescribing data (1998-2014) were combined with whole genome sequences from 4045 national and international C difficile isolates. Genotype (multilocus sequence type) and fluoroquinolone susceptibility were determined from whole genome sequences. The incidence of C difficile infections caused by fluoroquinolone-resistant and fluoroquinolone-susceptible isolates was estimated with negative-binomial regression, overall and per genotype. Selection and transmission were investigated with phylogenetic analyses. FINDINGS National fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin prescribing correlated highly with incidence of C difficile infections (cross-correlations {\textgreater}0{\textperiodcentered}88), by contrast with total antibiotic prescribing (cross-correlations {\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}59). Regionally, C difficile decline was driven by elimination of fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates (approximately 67{\%} of Oxfordshire infections in September, 2006, falling to approximately 3{\%} in February, 2013; annual incidence rate ratio 0{\textperiodcentered}52, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}48-0{\textperiodcentered}56 vs fluoroquinolone-susceptible isolates: 1{\textperiodcentered}02, 0{\textperiodcentered}97-1{\textperiodcentered}08). C difficile infections caused by fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates declined in four distinct genotypes (p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}01). The regions of phylogenies containing fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates were short-branched and geographically structured, consistent with selection and rapid transmission. The importance of fluoroquinolone restriction over infection control was shown by significant declines in inferred secondary (transmitted) cases caused by fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates with or without hospital contact (p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001) versus no change in either group of cases caused by fluoroquinolone-susceptible isolates (p{\textgreater}0{\textperiodcentered}2). INTERPRETATION Restricting fluoroquinolone prescribing appears to explain the decline in incidence of C difficile infections, above other measures, in Oxfordshire and Leeds, England. Antimicrobial stewardship should be a central component of C difficile infection control programmes.

@article{Goodman1999,
abstract = {Bayesian inference is usually presented as a method for determining how scientific belief should be modified by data. Although Bayesian methodology has been one of the most active areas of statistical development in the past 20 years, medical researchers have been reluctant to embrace what they perceive as a subjective approach to data analysis. It is little understood that Bayesian methods have a data-based core, which can be used as a calculus of evidence. This core is the Bayes factor, which in its simplest form is also called a likelihood ratio. The minimum Bayes factor is objective and can be used in lieu of the P value as a measure of the evidential strength. Unlike P values, Bayes factors have a sound theoretical foundation and an interpretation that allows their use in both inference and decision making. Bayes factors show that P values greatly overstate the evidence against the null hypothesis. Most important, Bayes factors require the addition of background knowledge to be transformed into inferences--probabilities that a given conclusion is right or wrong. They make the distinction clear between experimental evidence and inferential conclusions while providing a framework in which to combine prior with current evidence.},

@article{Li2007,
abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or “batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes () to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice. Software for our method is freely available at: http://biosun1.harvard.edu/complab/batch/.},

abstract = {Emerging and re-emerging mosquito-borne viruses continue to pose a significant threat to human health throughout the world. Over the past decade, West Nile virus (WNV), Dengue virus (DENV), and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), have caused annual epidemics of virus-induced encephalitis, hemorrhagic fever$\backslash$shock syndromes, and arthritis, respectively. Currently, no specific antiviral therapies or vaccines exist for use in humans to combat or prevent these viral infections. Thus, there is a pressing need to define the virus-host interactions that govern immunity and infection outcome. Recent technological breakthroughs in 'omics' resources and high-throughput based assays are beginning to accelerate antiviral drug discovery and improve on current strategies for vaccine design. In this review, we highlight studies with WNV and discuss how traditional and systems biological approaches are being used to rapidly identify novel host targets for therapeutic intervention and develop a deeper conceptual understanding of the host response to virus infection.},

@article{Mohammed2014,
abstract = {The emergence of massive datasets in a clinical setting presents both challenges and opportunities in data storage and analysis. This so called "big data" challenges traditional analytic tools and will increasingly require novel solutions adapted from other fields. Advances in information and communication technology present the most viable solutions to big data analysis in terms of efficiency and scalability. It is vital those big data solutions are multithreaded and that data access approaches be precisely tailored to large volumes of semi-structured/unstructured data. THE MAPREDUCE PROGRAMMING FRAMEWORK USES TWO TASKS COMMON IN FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING: Map and Reduce. MapReduce is a new parallel processing framework and Hadoop is its open-source implementation on a single computing node or on clusters. Compared with existing parallel processing paradigms (e.g. grid computing and graphical processing unit (GPU)), MapReduce and Hadoop have two advantages: 1) fault-tolerant storage resulting in reliable data processing by replicating the computing tasks, and cloning the data chunks on different computing nodes across the computing cluster; 2) high-throughput data processing via a batch processing framework and the Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS). Data are stored in the HDFS and made available to the slave nodes for computation. In this paper, we review the existing applications of the MapReduce programming framework and its implementation platform Hadoop in clinical big data and related medical health informatics fields. The usage of MapReduce and Hadoop on a distributed system represents a significant advance in clinical big data processing and utilization, and opens up new opportunities in the emerging era of big data analytics. The objective of this paper is to summarize the state-of-the-art efforts in clinical big data analytics and highlight what might be needed to enhance the outcomes of clinical big data analytics tools. This paper is concluded by summarizing the potential usage of the MapReduce programming framework and Hadoop platform to process huge volumes of clinical data in medical health informatics related fields.},

abstract = {The recent outbreak of Chikungunya virus in Thailand caused a rheumatic fever associated with considerable morbidity and fatalities. Thus, it is important to identify biomarker(s) of severe disease induced by this threatening arbovirus. Putative biomarkers in cases of chikungunya fever during an outbreak in the southern part of Thailand in 2009-2010 were identified. Sixty-two patients who had developed fever and myalgia, with or without arthralgia/arthritis, were enrolled and grouped into severe chikungunya fever (CHIKF) (n= 15), mild CHIKF (n= 20) and non-CHIKF (n= 27) to investigate circulating immunological mediators that might serve as markers of severity. Blood samples were taken at presentation (day 1) and 30 days later (day 30) and plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1$\beta$, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), matrix metalloproteinase-1, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 and viral load were measured by ELISA. On day 1, severe CHIKF and mild CHIKF groups had viral loads of 10(8.5) and 10(8.3) of RNA copies/mL, respectively. At presentation, all CHIKF patients had circulating concentrations of IL-6 and MCP-1 higher than did non-CHIKF patients, whereas amongst the CHKF patients, the severe CHIKF patients had higher IL-6 concentrations than did mild CHIKF patients. Interestingly, severe CHIKF patients had significantly lower concentrations of circulating IL-8 than the other groups of patients, suggesting that high concentrations of IL-6 and MCP-1 with low concentrations of IL-8 may be a determinant of severe chikungunya virus infection.},

One problem occurs when people apply Bayesian intuitions to significance testing—two approaches that must be firmly separated. This article presents some common situations in which the approaches come to different conclusions; you can see where your intuitions initially lie. The situations include multiple testing, deciding when to stop running participants, and when a theory was thought of relative to finding out results. The interpretation of nonsignificant results has also been persistently problematic in a way that Bayesian inference can clarify. The Bayesian and orthodox approaches are placed in the context of different notions of rationality, and I accuse myself and others as having been irrational in the way we have been using statistics on a key notion of rationality. The reader is shown how to apply Bayesian inference in practice, using free online software, to allow more coherent inferences from data.},

@article{Weger-Lucarelli2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging arbovirus associated with febrile illness often accompanied by rash and arthralgia that may persist for several years. Outbreaks are associated with high morbidity and create a public health challenge for countries affected. Recent outbreaks have occurred in both Europe and the Americas, suggesting CHIKV may continue to spread. Despite the sustained threat of the virus, there is no approved vaccine or antiviral therapy against CHIKV. Therefore, it is critical to develop a vaccine that is both well tolerated and highly protective. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we describe the construction and characterization of a modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) virus expressing CHIKV E3 and E2 proteins (MVA-CHIK) that protected several mouse models from challenge with CHIKV. In particular, BALB/c mice were completely protected against viremia upon challenge with CHIKV after two doses of MVA-CHIK. Additionally, A129 mice (deficient in IFN$\alpha$/$\beta$) were protected from viremia, footpad swelling, and mortality. While high anti-virus antibodies were elicited, low or undetectable levels of neutralizing antibodies were produced in both mouse models. However, passive transfer of MVA-CHIK immune serum to na{\"{i}}ve mice did not protect against mortality, suggesting that antibodies may not be the main effectors of protection afforded by MVA-CHIK. Furthermore, depletion of CD4+, but not CD8+ T-cells from vaccinated mice resulted in 100{\%} mortality, implicating the indispensable role of CD4+ T-cells in the protection afforded by MVA-CHIK. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results presented herein demonstrate the potential of MVA to effectively express CHIKV E3-E2 proteins and generate protective immune responses. Our findings challenge the assumption that only neutralizing antibodies are effective in providing protection against CHIKV, and provides a framework for the development of novel, more effective vaccine strategies to combat CHIKV.},

abstract = {Influenza virus of the H7N2 subtype has been introduced into noncommercial poultry in the United States, and this probably resulted in incidents of transmission of H7N2 virus to humans, documented in 2002 and 2003. This virus could be considered a potential threat to public health if it acquired person-to-person transmissibility. A favored approach for global pandemic preparedness includes development of prepandemic vaccines for any potential pandemic virus. To this end, we created a high-growth reassortant virus (H7N2-PR8) containing the genes for the hemagglutinin and the neuraminidase from a low-pathogenicity (H7N2) virus strain and the remaining six genes from a human vaccine strain (H1N1). The reassortant strain was evaluated to assess its antigenicity, safety, and protective efficacy using a mouse model. Antigenicity studies using ferret antibodies raised against H7N2-PR8 indicated that this virus confers broad cross-reactivity with divergent H7 viruses of different years and lineages. Mice and chickens inoculated with high doses of H7N2-PR8 supported virus replication but survived, indicating that this virus is comparable to other avian viruses of low pathogenicity. To assess the protective efficacy of H7N2-PR8, mice were immunized with two doses of formalin-inactivated H7N2-PR8, alone or with alum. Vaccinated mice subsequently challenged with highly pathogenic viruses from homologous and heterologous lineages A/Canada/444/04 (H7N3) and A/Netherlands/219/03 (H7N7) showed pronounced reduction of wild-type virus replication. These studies indicate that H7N2-PR8 is immunogenic, safe, and protective in animal models; these are the essential attributes to qualify for phase I human clinical trials as a prepandemic vaccine.},

However, since late 2009, measles virus transmission has increased, and outbreaks have become widespread. In 2011, measles outbreaks have been reported in 36 of 53 EUR member states; a total of 26,074 measles cases had been reported regionwide as of October 26. France reported the largest number of cases (approximately 14,000), predominantly among older children and young adults who had not been vaccinated or whose vaccination history was unknown. Overall, the primary reason for the increased transmission and outbreaks of measles in EUR is failure to vaccinate susceptible populations. Eliminating measles by 2015, a new measles elimination target date set in September 2010 by the 60th Regional Committee for Europe, will require 1) increasing demand for and delivery of vaccination to achieve and sustain ≥ 95{\%} coverage with 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) across a wide age range, 2) implementing effective outbreak control measures, and 3) further strengthening surveillance to identify cases and outbreaks promptly, and in the future, to validate elimination.},

In 2006, the world witnessed the first government-approved oncolytic virus for the treatment of head and neck cancer. It has been known for many years that viruses have the ability to replicate in and lyse cancer cells. Although encouraging results have been demonstrated in vitro and in animal models, most oncolytic viruses have failed to impress in the clinical setting. The explanation is multifactorial, determined by the complex interactions between the tumor and its microenvironment, the virus, and the host immune response. This review focuses on discussion of the obstacles that oncolytic virotherapy faces and recent advances made to overcome them, with particular reference to adenoviruses.},

The factors associated to the extension and persistence of symptoms are highlighted, focusing on (a) virus replication in target cells, and tissues, including macrophages and muscle cells; (b) the inflammatory and immune responses with recruitment and activation of macrophage, NK cells and T lymphocytes to the lesion focus and the increase of inflammatory mediators levels; and (c) the persistence of virus or viral products in joint and muscle tissues. We also discuss the importance of the establishment of novel animal models to test new molecular targets and to develop more efficient and selective drugs to treat these diseases.},

abstract = {Public transit systems are ideal for studying the urban microbiome and interindividual community transfer. In this study, we used 16S amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to profile microbial communities on multiple transit surfaces across train lines and stations in the Boston metropolitan transit system. The greatest determinant of microbial community structure was the transit surface type. In contrast, little variation was observed between geographically distinct train lines and stations serving different demographics. All surfaces were dominated by human skin and oral commensals such as Propionibacterium, Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus. The detected taxa not associated with humans included generalists from alphaproteobacteria, which were especially abundant on outdoor touchscreens. Shotgun metagenomics further identified viral and eukaryotic microbes, including Propionibacterium phage and Malassezia globosa. Functional profiling showed that Propionibacterium acnes pathways such as propionate production and porphyrin synthesis were enriched on train holding surfaces (holds), while electron transport chain components for aerobic respiration were enriched on touchscreens and seats. Lastly, the transit environment was not found to be a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes. Our results suggest that microbial communities on transit surfaces are maintained from a metapopulation of human skin commensals and environmental generalists, with enrichments corresponding to local interactions with the human body and environmental exposures.IMPORTANCE Mass transit environments, specifically, urban subways, are distinct microbial environments with high occupant densities, diversities, and turnovers, and they are thus especially relevant to public health. Despite this, only three culture-independent subway studies have been performed, all since 2013 and all with widely differing designs and conclusions. In this study, we profiled the Boston subway system, which provides 238 million trips per year overseen by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). This yielded the first high-precision microbial survey of a variety of surfaces, ridership environments, and microbiological functions (including tests for potential pathogenicity) in a mass transit environment. Characterizing microbial profiles for multiple transit systems will become increasingly important for biosurveillance of antibiotic resistance genes or pathogens, which can be early indicators for outbreak or sanitation events. Understanding how human contact, materials, and the environment affect microbial profiles may eventually allow us to rationally design public spaces to sustain our health in the presence of microbial reservoirs.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To test whether smeDEF overexpression leads to a predictable multi-drug resistance phenotype in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and to measure the frequency with which smeDEF overexpression occurs in clinical isolates and in spontaneous drug-resistant mutants. METHODS: Overexpression of smeDEF was induced in clinical isolates by the introduction of chromosomal mutations in smeT using a gene-replacement approach. Spontaneous drug-resistant mutants were selected using greater than MIC concentrations of various antimicrobial agents. Levels of smeE and smeF mRNAs were quantified using RT-PCR; MICs were determined using Etest. RESULTS: Of 20 spontaneous S. maltophilia drug-resistant mutants tested, four overexpressed smeDEF, but only two carried mutations within smeT. Of 30 clinical isolates tested, 6 significantly overexpressed smeDEF. One of these had an IS1246-like element embedded within the putative SmeT binding site in the smeDEF promoter. All smeDEF overexpressing derivatives of an isolate had the same resistance profile; derivatives that did not overexpress smeDEF did not share this resistance profile. However, no consistent phenotype could be associated with smeDEF overexpression in S. maltophilia isolates per se. CONCLUSIONS: SmeT is not the only gene product that affects smeDEF expression. IS element insertion is a viable mechanism by which smeDEF expression can be derepressed. There is evidence for a background-specific, predictable effect on resistance profile when smeDEF is overexpressed, but the variability of backgrounds encountered means no general SmeDEF-mediated phenotype can be defined. There is strong evidence for the existence of as yet unidentified multi-drug efflux pumps in this species.},

abstract = {Flow cytometry datasets from clinical trials generate very large datasets and are usually highly standardized, focusing on endpoints that are well defined apriori. Staining variability of individual makers is not uncommon and complicates manual gating, requiring the analyst to adapt gates for each sample, which is unwieldy for large datasets. It can lead to unreliable measurements, especially if a template-gating approach is used without further correction to the gates. In this article, a computational framework is presented for normalizing the fluorescence intensity of multiple markers in specific cell populations across samples that is suitable for high-throughput processing of large clinical trial datasets. Previous approaches to normalization have been global and applied to all cells or data with debris removed. They provided no mechanism to handle specific cell subsets. This approach integrates tightly with the gating process so that normalization is performed during gating and is local to the specific cell subsets exhibiting variability. This improves peak alignment and the performance of the algorithm. The performance of this algorithm is demonstrated on two clinical trial datasets from the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) and the Immune Tolerance Network (ITN). In the ITN data set we show that local normalization combined with template gating can account for sample-to-sample variability as effectively as manual gating. In the HVTN dataset, it is shown that local normalization mitigates false-positive vaccine response calls in an intracellular cytokine staining assay. In both datasets, local normalization performs better than global normalization. The normalization framework allows the use of template gates even in the presence of sample-to-sample staining variability, mitigates the subjectivity and bias of manual gating, and decreases the time necessary to analyze large datasets. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.},

abstract = {Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor of adults and one of the most lethal of all cancers. Patients with this disease have a median survival of 15 months from the time of diagnosis despite surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. New treatment approaches are needed. Recent works suggest that glioblastoma patients may benefit from molecularly targeted therapies. Here, we address the compelling need for identification of new molecular targets. Leveraging global gene expression data from two independent sets of clinical tumor samples (n = 55 and n = 65), we identify a gene coexpression module in glioblastoma that is also present in breast cancer and significantly overlaps with the "metasignature" for undifferentiated cancer. Studies in an isogenic model system demonstrate that this module is downstream of the mutant epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFRvIII, and that it can be inhibited by the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor Erlotinib. We identify ASPM (abnormal spindle-like microcephaly associated) as a key gene within this module and demonstrate its overexpression in glioblastoma relative to normal brain (or body tissues). Finally, we show that ASPM inhibition by siRNA-mediated knockdown inhibits tumor cell proliferation and neural stem cell proliferation, supporting ASPM as a potential molecular target in glioblastoma.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Smartphones and tablet devices have become ubiquitous, and their adoption in the health care arena is growing. Reviews have looked at their utilities within medical specialties. Despite the many surgical apps available currently, there has not been a comprehensive literature review evaluating uses of these platforms within surgical disciplines. We reviewed the literature systematically in this regard.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Embase, MEDLINE, Health Management Informatics Consortium, and PsychINFO databases were searched for empiric quantitative studies evaluating interventions based in the use of smartphone or tablet device within surgical disciplines targeted at surgeons, patients, or the wider public.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Of the 39 studies included, 24 evaluated smartphone-based interventions and 15 looked at tablet devices, whereas 30 were app-based interventions and 9 were not. A wide range of effective and innovative utilities were identified and categorized into 8 domains; Diagnostics (n = 11), telemedicine (n = 9), operative navigation (n = 6), training (n = 5), data collection (n = 3), patient education (n = 2), behavior change (n = 2), and operative planning (n = 1).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This comprehensive systematic literature review of smartphone and tablet device use in surgery demonstrates a wide range of innovative utilities in the pre-, intra-, and postoperative contexts. Although results of individual studies generally were favorable, limitations in methodologies existed in many, and although studies clearly highlight the substantial potential of smartphone and tablet devices in the surgical setting, trials of greater quality will be necessary to pave the way for their widespread adoption.},

@article{Huson2007,
abstract = {Metagenomics is the study of the genomic content of a sample of organisms obtained from a common habitat using targeted or random sequencing. Goals include understanding the extent and role of microbial diversity. The taxonomical content of such a sample is usually estimated by comparison against sequence databases of known sequences. Most published studies use the analysis of paired-end reads, complete sequences of environmental fosmid and BAC clones, or environmental assemblies. Emerging sequencing-by-synthesis technologies with very high throughput are paving the way to low-cost random "shotgun" approaches. This paper introduces MEGAN, a new computer program that allows laptop analysis of large metagenomic data sets. In a preprocessing step, the set of DNA sequences is compared against databases of known sequences using BLAST or another comparison tool. MEGAN is then used to compute and explore the taxonomical content of the data set, employing the NCBI taxonomy to summarize and order the results. A simple lowest common ancestor algorithm assigns reads to taxa such that the taxonomical level of the assigned taxon reflects the level of conservation of the sequence. The software allows large data sets to be dissected without the need for assembly or the targeting of specific phylogenetic markers. It provides graphical and statistical output for comparing different data sets. The approach is applied to several data sets, including the Sargasso Sea data set, a recently published metagenomic data set sampled from a mammoth bone, and several complete microbial genomes. Also, simulations that evaluate the performance of the approach for different read lengths are presented.},

This seems to be largely due to the hemagglutinin of A/NWS/33. The complete nucleotide sequence of the HA genes of both strains has been determined and a comparison revealed a number of changes. Analysis showed that the virulence capabilities of the NWS HA involve at least three different mechanisms: (a) loss of a glycosylation site; (b) a change at the cleavage site; and (c) a substitution in HA2, which may increase the pH of fusion.},

abstract = {Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne arthralgia arbovirus that is reemergent in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. CHIKV infection has been shown to be self-limiting, but the molecular mechanisms of the innate immune response that control CHIKV replication remain undefined. Here, longitudinal transcriptional analyses of PBMCs from a cohort of CHIKV-infected patients revealed that type I IFNs controlled CHIKV infection via RSAD2 (which encodes viperin), an enigmatic multifunctional IFN-stimulated gene (ISG). Viperin was highly induced in monocytes, the major target cell of CHIKV in blood. Anti-CHIKV functions of viperin were dependent on its localization in the ER, and the N-terminal amphipathic $\alpha$-helical domain was crucial for its antiviral activity in controlling CHIKV replication. Furthermore, mice lacking Rsad2 had higher viremia and severe joint inflammation compared with wild-type mice. Our data demonstrate that viperin is a critical antiviral host protein that controls CHIKV infection and provide a preclinical basis for the design of effective control strategies against CHIKV and other reemerging arthrogenic alphaviruses.},

abstract = {Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) allows for effective tracing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) (tuberculosis pathogens) transmission. However, it is difficult to standardize and, therefore, is not yet employed for interlaboratory prospective surveillance. To allow its widespread application, solutions for data standardization and storage in an easily expandable database are urgently needed. To address this question, we developed a core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) scheme for clinical MTBC isolates using the Ridom SeqSphere(+) software, which transfers the genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) diversity into an allele numbering system that is standardized, portable, and not computationally intensive. To test its performance, we performed WGS analysis of 26 isolates with identical IS6110 DNA fingerprints and spoligotyping patterns from a longitudinal outbreak in the federal state of Hamburg, Germany (notified between 2001 and 2010). The cgMLST approach (3,041 genes) discriminated the 26 strains with a resolution comparable to that of SNP-based WGS typing (one major cluster of 22 identical or closely related and four outlier isolates with at least 97 distinct SNPs or 63 allelic variants). Resulting tree topologies are highly congruent and grouped the isolates in both cases analogously. Our data show that SNP- and cgMLST-based WGS analyses facilitate high-resolution discrimination of longitudinal MTBC outbreaks. cgMLST allows for a meaningful epidemiological interpretation of the WGS genotyping data. It enables standardized WGS genotyping for epidemiological investigations, e.g., on the regional public health office level, and the creation of web-accessible databases for global TB surveillance with an integrated early warning system.},

The use of a single molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing provided a closed genome in a single sequencing run. K. pneumoniae PittNDM01 had a single chromosome of 5,348,284 bp and four plasmids, pPKPN1(283,371 bp), pPKPN2 (103,694 bp), pPKPN3 (70,814 bp), and pPKPN4 (6,141 bp). The contents of the chromosome were similar to that of the K. pneumoniae reference genome MGH 78578, with the exception of a large inversion spanning 23.3{\%} of the chromosome. In contrast, three of the four plasmids were unique. The plasmid pPKPN1, an IncHI1B-like plasmid, encoded blaNDM-1, armA and qnrB1 along with tellurium and mercury resistance operons. blaNDM-1 was carried on a unique structure where Tn125 was further bracketed by IS26 downstream of a class 1 integron. IncFIA-like plasmid pPKPN3 also encoded an array of resistance elements including blaCTX-M-15 and a mercury resistance operon. ColE-type pPKPN4 encoding blaOXA-232 was identical to a plasmid previously reported from France. SMRT sequencing was useful in resolving complex bacterial genomic structures in de novo assemblies.},

However, practical deployment of the technology is hindered by the bioinformatics challenge of analyzing results accurately and in a clinically relevant timeframe. Here we describe SURPI ("sequence-based ultrarapid pathogen identification"), a computational pipeline for pathogen identification from complex metagenomic NGS data generated from clinical samples, and demonstrate use of the pipeline in the analysis of 237 clinical samples comprising more than 1.1 billion sequences. Deployable on both cloud-based and standalone servers, SURPI leverages two state-of-the-art aligners for accelerated analyses, SNAP and RAPSearch, which are as accurate as existing bioinformatics tools but orders of magnitude faster in performance. In fast mode, SURPI detects viruses and bacteria by scanning data sets of 7-500 million reads in 11 min to 5 h, while in comprehensive mode, all known microorganisms are identified, followed by de novo assembly and protein homology searches for divergent viruses in 50 min to 16 h. SURPI has also directly contributed to real-time microbial diagnosis in acutely ill patients, underscoring its potential key role in the development of unbiased NGS-based clinical assays in infectious diseases that demand rapid turnaround times.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia causes opportunistic infections and remains a problem pathogen on intensive care unit (ICU) due to its multidrug resistance. AIM: An outbreak of S. maltophilia on ICU is described in order to highlight the risk from contaminated devices for supply of drinking water. METHODS: The outbreak was investigated by a combination of epidemiology, environmental sampling and molecular typing. FINDINGS: From 2009 to 2011 isolates of S. maltophilia from 23 patients were found to belong to only two genotypes by contrast with isolates from 52 other patients during this period, which represented distinct strains. The monthly incidence for all S. maltophilia strains ranged from 0 to 11{\%} and for the two outbreak strains from 0 to 9{\%}. Admission and weekly pharyngeal screening on ICU showed that the outbreak strains were acquired on ICU (range: 3-90 days). The majority of isolates (74{\%}) were from the respiratory tract. Only two of 12 (17{\%}) colonized intubated patients developed pneumonia. Environmental sampling found the two outbreak strains in two sinks and in the drinking water of the cooling unit in the ICU kitchen. S. maltophilia had formed a biofilm in the flexible tube from the carbon filter to the chiller and from the latter to the tap at the kitchen sink. This cooled water was used for providing drinking water and mouth care to ICU patients. The outbreak strains disappeared after removal of the water-cooler and the monthly incidence fell to {\textless}2{\%} of ICU admissions. CONCLUSION: This outbreak report highlights the risk from biofilms in devices that supply drinking water for ICU patients.},

abstract = {One of the major missions of animal virology is to understand how viruses replicate and cause asymptomatic/symptomatic con-ditions in individuals (Nomaguchi and Adachi, 2010). It is espe-cially important for virologists who work on viruses pathogenic for humans to elucidate bases underlying the in vivo viral charac-teristics. Toward this end, animal model studies in some ways are necessary to precisely analyze the in vivo situation, and also are essential for developing countermeasures against virus infections. Since a full variety of viruses with distinct biological properties exist, we virologists should study " the target virus " in a special-ized manner, in addition to common theoretical/experimental approaches. The Research Topic entitled " Animal model stud-ies on viral infections " collects articles that describe the studies on numerous virus species for their animal models, or those at various stages toward animal experiments. Articles in this Research Topic were written by experts in various research fields, and can be fairly grouped into a few categories: (i) descriptions/evaluations/new challenges of animal model studies for investigating the biology of viruses; (ii) exper-imental materials/methods for upcoming animal model stud-ies; (iii) observations important for animal model studies. (i) Reynaud and Horvat (2013) have described the animal mod-els for human herpesvirus 6 to better understand its pathogenic property. Studies on filoviruses, classified as biosafety level-4 and represent a serious world-wide problem today, have been reviewed by Nakayama and Saijo (2013). Mailly et al. (2013) have focused on the quest for appropriate animal models for hepatitis C virus. Clark et al. (2013) have discussed about the use of non-human primates as models for dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. Ohsugi (2013) has summarized mouse strains transgenic for the tax gene of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Also, a bovine model for HTLV-1 patho-genesis has been described by Aida et al. (2013). Challenging new attempts to establish human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)/macaque infection models have been reviewed by Misra et al. (2013), and also by Saito and Akari (2013). Another approach to understand HIV-1 biology in vivo has been described by Matsuyama-Murata et al. (2013). (ii) Kodama et al. (2013) has described a new and simple method to prepare human dendritic cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Doi et al. (2013) have summarized their studies on macaque-tropic HIV-1 clones. Ikeno et al. (2013) has reported a new, sensitive, and quantitative system to monitor measles virus infection in humanized mice. Iwami et al. (2013) have summarized the quantification of viral infection dynamics based on various quantitative analyses. (iii) Tada et al. (2013) have suggested that LEDGF/p75 may be a cel-lular factor acting as a species-barrier against HIV-1 in mouse cells. Kuwata et al. (2013) have shown that simian immunode-ficiency virus may acquire the increased infectivity and resistance to neutralizing antibodies by truncation of its gp41 cytoplasmic tail. Ohsugi et al. (2013) have reported that natural infection sta-tus of laboratory mice by murine norovirus. Finally, Kajitani et al. (2013) have described the possible involvement of E1 ∧ E4 protein of human papillomavirus type 18 in its differentiation-dependent life cycle. We are proud to add our " Animal model studies on viral infec-tions " to a series of Research Topic in Frontiers in Microbiology. A wide variety of DNA and RNA viruses are covered by this special issue consisting of original research, review, mini-review, methods, and opinion articles. As we described in the beginning, animal studies are certainly required for understanding virus replicative/pathogenic properties in vivo and for overcoming virally-caused infectious diseases. We human virologists should make every effort to fight against numbers of unique pathogenic viruses.},

Turn-around times (TAT) were measured and total costs for sequencing per isolate were calculated. After cancelling prior policies of preemptive isolation of patients harboring certain Gram-negative MDR bacteria in risk areas, the second interval was conducted. During interval I, 645 bacterial isolates were sequenced. From culture, TATs ranged from 4.4 to 5.3 days, and costs were 202.49 € per isolate. During interval II, 550 bacterial isolates were sequenced. Hospital-wide transmission rates of the two most common species (MRSA and MDR {\textless}italic{\textgreater}E. coli{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ) were low during intervals I (5.8 and 2.3 {\%}, respectively) and II (4.3 {\%} and 5.0 {\%}, respectively). Cancellation of isolation of non-pan-resistant MDR {\textless}italic{\textgreater}E. coli{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} in risk wards did not increase transmission. When comparing sequencing costs with avoided costs mostly due to less blocked beds during interval II, we saved in excess of at least 200.000 €.

abstract = {Colistin is one of the few agents that retain activity against extensively drug-resistant strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae producing KPC-type carbapenemases (KPC-KP). However, resistance to colistin is increasingly reported among KPC-KP. Comparative genomic analysis of a pair of sequential KPC-KP isolates from the same patient including a colistin-susceptible isolate (KKBO-1) and a colistin-resistant isolate (KKBO-4) selected after colistin exposure revealed that insertional inactivation of the mgrB gene, encoding a negative regulator of the PhoQ/PhoP signaling system, is a genetic mechanism for acquired colistin resistance. The role of mgrB inactivation in acquired colistin resistance was confirmed by complementation experiments with wild-type mgrB, which restored colistin susceptibility in KKBO-4, and by construction of an mgrB deletion mutant from KKBO-1, which exhibited a colistin-resistant phenotype. Insertional mgrB inactivation was also detected in 60{\%} of colistin-resistant mutants selected from KKBO-1 in vitro, following plating on colistin-containing medium, confirming the role (although not unique) of this mechanism in the emergence of acquired colistin resistance. In colistin-resistant mutants carrying insertional inactivation or deletion of the mgrB gene, upregulated transcription of phoP, phoQ, and pmrK (which is part of the pmrHFIJKLM operon) was detected. These findings confirmed the MgrB regulatory role in K. pneumoniae and were in agreement with the known association between upregulation of the PhoQ/PhoP system and activation of the pmrHFIJKLM operon, which eventually leads to resistance to polymyxins by modification of the lipopolysaccharide target.},

DENV-2 productive infection induces activation and release of high levels of chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines in monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs), with the notable exception of alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta). Interestingly, DENV-2-infected moDCs fail to prime T cells, most likely due to the lack of IFN-alpha/beta released by moDCs, since this effect was reversed by addition of exogenous IFN-beta. Together, our data show that inhibition of IFN-alpha/beta production by DENV in primary human moDCs is a novel mechanism of immune evasion.},

Previous studies have proved a 3D dynamic simulated microgravity (SMG) culture system as a "stimulatory" environment for the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells. Here, we employed the NASA-approved rotary bioreactor to investigate the proliferation and differentiation of human epidermal stem cells (hEpSCs). hEpSCs were isolated from children foreskins and enriched by collecting epidermal stem cell colonies. Cytodex-3 micro-carriers and hEpSCs were co-cultured in the rotary bioreactor and 6-well dish for 15 days. The result showed that hEpSCs cultured in rotary bioreactor exhibited enhanced proliferation and viability surpassing those cultured in static conditions. Additionally, immunostaining analysis confirmed higher percentage of ki67 positive cells in rotary bioreactor compared with the static culture. In contrast, comparing with static culture, cells in the rotary bioreactor displayed a low expression of involucrin at day 10. Histological analysis revealed that cells cultured in rotary bioreactor aggregated on the micro-carriers and formed multilayer 3D epidermis structures. In conclusion, our research suggests that NASA-approved rotary bioreactor can support the proliferation of hEpSCs and provide a strategy to form multilayer epidermis structure.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease involves a variety of phenotypic changes, suggesting a general alteration in genome activity.

RESULTS: Investigation of different tissue transcriptomes in male and female F3 generation vinclozolin versus control lineage rats demonstrated all tissues examined had transgenerational transcriptomes. The microarrays from 11 different tissues were compared with a gene bionetwork analysis. Although each tissue transgenerational transcriptome was unique, common cellular pathways and processes were identified between the tissues. A cluster analysis identified gene modules with coordinated gene expression and each had unique gene networks regulating tissue-specific gene expression and function. A large number of statistically significant over-represented clusters of genes were identified in the genome for both males and females. These gene clusters ranged from 2-5 megabases in size, and a number of them corresponded to the epimutations previously identified in sperm that transmit the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease phenotypes.

CONCLUSIONS: Combined observations demonstrate that all tissues derived from the epigenetically altered germ line develop transgenerational transcriptomes unique to the tissue, but common epigenetic control regions in the genome may coordinately regulate these tissue-specific transcriptomes. This systems biology approach provides insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of a variety of adult onset disease phenotypes.},

abstract = {Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a common reason for seeking medical attention, and the threat of pandemic influenza will likely add to these numbers. Using human viral challenge studies with live rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A, we developed peripheral blood gene expression signatures that distinguish individuals with symptomatic ARIs from uninfected individuals with {\textgreater}95{\%} accuracy. We validated this "acute respiratory viral" signature-encompassing genes with a known role in host defense against viral infections-across each viral challenge. We also validated the signature in an independently acquired data set for influenza A and classified infected individuals from healthy controls with 100{\%} accuracy. In the same data set, we could also distinguish viral from bacterial ARIs (93{\%} accuracy). These results demonstrate that ARIs induce changes in human peripheral blood gene expression that can be used to diagnose a viral etiology of respiratory infection and triage symptomatic individuals.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: System-wide profiling of genes and proteins in mammalian cells produce lists of differentially expressed genes/proteins that need to be further analyzed for their collective functions in order to extract new knowledge. Once unbiased lists of genes or proteins are generated from such experiments, these lists are used as input for computing enrichment with existing lists created from prior knowledge organized into gene-set libraries. While many enrichment analysis tools and gene-set libraries databases have been developed, there is still room for improvement.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here, we present Enrichr, an integrative web-based and mobile software application that includes new gene-set libraries, an alternative approach to rank enriched terms, and various interactive visualization approaches to display enrichment results using the JavaScript library, Data Driven Documents (D3). The software can also be embedded into any tool that performs gene list analysis. We applied Enrichr to analyze nine cancer cell lines by comparing their enrichment signatures to the enrichment signatures of matched normal tissues. We observed a common pattern of up regulation of the polycomb group PRC2 and enrichment for the histone mark H3K27me3 in many cancer cell lines, as well as alterations in Toll-like receptor and interlukin signaling in K562 cells when compared with normal myeloid CD33+ cells. Such analyses provide global visualization of critical differences between normal tissues and cancer cell lines but can be applied to many other scenarios.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Enrichr is an easy to use intuitive enrichment analysis web-based tool providing various types of visualization summaries of collective functions of gene lists. Enrichr is open source and freely available online at: http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr.},

abstract = {The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list - reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Recently, the official nomenclature subdivides monocytes into three subsets, the additional subset arising from the segregation of the CD16+ monocytes into two based on relative expression of CD14. Recent whole genome analysis reveal that specialized functions and phenotypes can be attributed to these newly defined monocyte subsets. In this review, we discuss these recent results, and also the description and utility of this new segregation in several disease conditions. We also discuss alternative markers for segregating the monocyte subsets, for example using Tie-2 and slan, which do not necessarily follow the official method of segregating monocyte subsets based on relative CD14 and CD16 expressions.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Long-acting opioids increase the risk of unintentional overdose deaths but also may increase mortality from cardiorespiratory and other causes. OBJECTIVE: To compare all-cause mortality for patients with chronic noncancer pain who were prescribed either long-acting opioids or alternative medications for moderate to severe chronic pain. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study between 1999 and 2012 of Tennessee Medicaid patients with chronic noncancer pain and no evidence of palliative or end-of-life care. EXPOSURES: Propensity score-matched new episodes of prescribed therapy for long-acting opioids or either analgesic anticonvulsants or low-dose cyclic antidepressants (control medications). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Total and cause-specific mortality as determined from death certificates. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and risk differences (difference in incidence of death) were calculated for long-acting opioid therapy vs control medication. RESULTS: There were 22,912 new episodes of prescribed therapy for both long-acting opioids and control medications (mean [SD] age, 48 [11] years; 60{\%} women). The long-acting opioid group was followed up for a mean 176 days and had 185 deaths and the control treatment group was followed up for a mean 128 days and had 87 deaths. The HR for total mortality was 1.64 (95{\%} CI, 1.26-2.12) with a risk difference of 68.5 excess deaths (95{\%} CI, 28.2-120.7) per 10,000 person-years. Increased risk was due to out-of-hospital deaths (154 long-acting opioid, 60 control deaths; HR, 1.90; 95{\%} CI, 1.40-2.58; risk difference, 67.1; 95{\%} CI, 30.1-117.3) excess deaths per 10,000 person-years. For out-of-hospital deaths other than unintentional overdose (120 long-acting opioid, 53 control deaths), the HR was 1.72 (95{\%} CI, 1.24-2.39) with a risk difference of 47.4 excess deaths (95{\%} CI, 15.7-91.4) per 10,000 person-years. The HR for cardiovascular deaths (79 long-acting opioid, 36 control deaths) was 1.65 (95{\%} CI, 1.10-2.46) with a risk difference of 28.9 excess deaths (95{\%} CI, 4.6-65.3) per 10,000 person-years. The HR during the first 30 days of therapy (53 long-acting opioid, 13 control deaths) was 4.16 (95{\%} CI, 2.27-7.63) with a risk difference of 200 excess deaths (95{\%} CI, 80-420) per 10,000 person-years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Prescription of long-acting opioids for chronic noncancer pain, compared with anticonvulsants or cyclic antidepressants, was associated with a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality, including deaths from causes other than overdose, with a modest absolute risk difference. These findings should be considered when evaluating harms and benefits of treatment.},

The re-emergence of CHIKV has also resulted in numerous outbreaks in several countries in the eastern hemisphere, with a threat to further expand in the near future. However, there is no vaccine against CHIKV infection licensed for human use, and therapy for CHIKV infection is still mainly limited to supportive care as antiviral agents are yet in different stages of testing or development.

Regional systems are being established through the integration of local surveillance data across multiple facilities. We studied how different methods of data integration affect outbreak detection performance. We used a simulation relying on a semi-synthetic dataset, introducing simulated outbreaks of different sizes into historical visit data from two hospitals. In one simulation, we introduced the synthetic outbreak evenly into both hospital datasets (aggregate model). In the second, the outbreak was introduced into only one or the other of the hospital datasets (local model). We found that the aggregate model had a higher sensitivity for detecting outbreaks that were evenly distributed between the hospitals. However, for outbreaks that were localized to one facility, maintaining individual models for each location proved to be better. Given the complementary benefits offered by both approaches, the results suggest building a hybrid system that includes both individual models for each location, and an aggregate model that combines all the data. We also discuss options for multi-level signal integration hierarchies.},

abstract = {Although prior studies have investigated cellular infection by dengue virus (DV), many have used highly passaged strains. We have reassessed cellular infection by DV type 2 (DV2) using prototype and low-passage isolates representing genotypes from different geographic areas. We observed marked variation in the susceptibility to infection among cell types by different DV2 strains. HepG2 hepatoma cells were susceptible to infection by all DV2 strains assayed. Although the prototype strain generated higher titers of secreted virus than the low-passage isolates, this difference did not correspond to positive- or negative-strand viral RNA levels and thus may reflect variation in efficiency among DV2 isolates to translate viral proteins or package and/or secrete virus. In contrast, human foreskin fibroblasts were susceptible to the prototype and low-passage Thai isolates but not to five Nicaraguan strains tested, as reflected by the absence of accumulation of negative-strand viral RNA, viral antigen, and infectious virus. A similar pattern was observed with the antibody-dependent pathway of infection. U937 and THP-1 myeloid cells and peripheral blood monocytes were infected in the presence of enhancing antibodies by the prototype strain but not by low-passage Nicaraguan isolates. Again, the barrier appeared to be prior to negative-strand accumulation. Thus, depending on the cell type and viral isolate, blocks that limit the production of infectious virus in vitro may occur at distinct steps in the pathway of cellular infection.},

The result demonstrates that the decomposition of reads into kmers employed in the de Bruijn graph approach described earlier is not essential, and exposes its close connection to the unitig approach we developed at Celera. This paper is a preliminary piece giving the basic algorithm and results that demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the method. These ideas are being used to build a next-generation whole genome assembler called BOA (Berkeley Open Assembler) that will easily scale to mammalian genomes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been suggested as a new treatment to manage Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). With use of a mathematical model of C. difficile within an intensive care unit (ICU), we examined the potential impact of routine FMT.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A mathematical model of C. difficile transmission, supplemented with prospective cohort, surveillance, and billing data from hospitals in the southeastern United States.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Cohort, surveillance, and billing data as well as data from the literature were used to construct a compartmental model of CDI within an ICU. Patients were defined as being in 1 of 6 potential health states: uncolonized and at low risk; uncolonized and at high risk; colonized and at low risk; colonized and at high risk; having CDI; or treated with FMT.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The use of FMT to treat patients after CDI was associated with a statistically significant reduction in recurrence but not with a reduction in incident cases. Treatment after administration of high-risk medications, such as antibiotics, did not result in a decrease in recurrence but did result in a statistically significant difference in incident cases across treatment groups, although whether this difference was clinically relevant was questionable.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our study is a novel mathematical model that examines the effect of FMT on the prevention of recurrent and incident CDI. The routine use of FMT represents a promising approach to reduce complex recurrent cases, but a reduction in CDI incidence will require the use of other methods to prevent transmission.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dengue virus (DENV) infection can range in severity from mild dengue fever (DF) to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Changes in host gene expression, temporally through the progression of DENV infection, especially during the early days, remains poorly characterized. Early diagnostic markers for DHF are also lacking.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we investigated host gene expression in a cohort of DENV-infected subjects clinically diagnosed as DF (n = 51) and DHF (n = 13) from Maracay, Venezuela. Blood specimens were collected daily from these subjects from enrollment to early defervescence and at one convalescent time-point. Using convalescent expression levels as baseline, two distinct groups of genes were identified: the "early" group, which included genes associated with innate immunity, type I interferon, cytokine-mediated signaling, chemotaxis, and complement activity peaked at day 0-1 and declined on day 3-4; the second "late" group, comprised of genes associated with cell cycle, emerged from day 4 and peaked at day 5-6. The up-regulation of innate immune response genes coincided with the down-regulation of genes associated with viral replication during day 0-3. Furthermore, DHF patients had lower expression of genes associated with antigen processing and presentation, MHC class II receptor, NK and T cell activities, compared to that of DF patients. These results suggested that the innate and adaptive immunity during the early days of the disease are vital in suppressing DENV replication and in affecting outcome of disease severity. Gene signatures of DHF were identified as early as day 1.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study reveals a broad and dynamic picture of host responses in DENV infected subjects. Host response to DENV infection can now be understood as two distinct phases with unique transcriptional markers. The DHF signatures identified during day 1-3 may have applications in developing early molecular diagnostics for DHF.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Health care-associated infections (HAIs) account for a large proportion of the harms caused by health care and are associated with high costs. Better evaluation of the costs of these infections could help providers and payers to justify investing in prevention.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To estimate costs associated with the most significant and targetable HAIs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA SOURCES: For estimation of attributable costs, we conducted a systematic review of the literature using PubMed for the years 1986 through April 2013. For HAI incidence estimates, we used the National Healthcare Safety Network of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSTUDY SELECTION: Studies performed outside the United States were excluded. Inclusion criteria included a robust method of comparison using a matched control group or an appropriate regression strategy, generalizable populations typical of inpatient wards and critical care units, methodologic consistency with CDC definitions, and soundness of handling economic outcomes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Three review cycles were completed, with the final iteration carried out from July 2011 to April 2013. Selected publications underwent a secondary review by the research team.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Costs, inflated to 2012 US dollars.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Using Monte Carlo simulation, we generated point estimates and 95{\%} CIs for attributable costs and length of hospital stay. On a per-case basis, central line-associated bloodstream infections were found to be the most costly HAIs at {\$}45,814 (95{\%} CI, {\$}30,919-{\$}65,245), followed by ventilator-associated pneumonia at {\$}40,144 (95{\%} CI, {\$}36,286-{\$}44,220), surgical site infections at {\$}20,785 (95{\%} CI, {\$}18,902-{\$}22,667), Clostridium difficile infection at {\$}11,285 (95{\%} CI, {\$}9118-{\$}13,574), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections at {\$}896 (95{\%} CI, {\$}603-{\$}1189). The total annual costs for the 5 major infections were {\$}9.8 billion (95{\%} CI, {\$}8.3-{\$}11.5 billion), with surgical site infections contributing the most to overall costs (33.7{\%} of the total), followed by ventilator-associated pneumonia (31.6{\%}), central line-associated bloodstream infections (18.9{\%}), C difficile infections (15.4{\%}), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections ({\textless}1{\%}).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: While quality improvement initiatives have decreased HAI incidence and costs, much more remains to be done. As hospitals realize savings from prevention of these complications under payment reforms, they may be more likely to invest in such strategies.},

There is a growing number of targeted therapies approved and in the pipeline, which meets a new set of problems with efficacy and adverse effects. The pitfalls of these mechanistically based drugs are described, along with how a systems view of drug action is increasingly important to uncover intricate signaling mechanisms that play an important part in drug action, resistance mechanisms, and off-target effects. Computational methodologies enable the classification of drugs according to their structures and to which proteins they bind. Recent studies have combined the structural analyses with analysis of regulatory networks to make predictions about the therapeutic effects of drugs for complex diseases and possible off-target effects.},

Robust analytical pipelines of genomic data provides in a short lapse of time (hours) information about taxonomy, comparative genomics (pan-genome) and single polymorphisms profiles. Pathogenic organisms of interest can be tracked at the genomic level, allowing monitoring at one-time several variables including: epidemiology, pathogenicity, resistance to antibiotics, virulence, persistence factors, mobile elements and adaptation features. Such information can be obtained not only at large spectra, but also at the “local” level, such as in the event of a recurrent or emergency outbreak. This paper reviews the state of the art in infection diagnostics in the context of modern NGS methodologies. We describe how actuation protocols in a public health environment will benefit from a “streaming approach” (pipeline). Such pipeline would include NGS data quality assessment, data mining for comparative analysis, searching differential genetic features, such as virulence, resistance persistence factors and mutation profiles (SNPs and InDels) and formatted “comprehensible” results. Such analytical protocols will enable a quick response to the needs of locally circumscribed outbreaks, providing information on the causes of resistance and genetic tracking elements for rapid detection, and monitoring actuations for present and future occurrences.},

abstract = {The inference of regulatory and biochemical networks from large-scale genomics data is a basic problem in molecular biology. The goal is to generate testable hypotheses of gene-to-gene influences and subsequently to design bench experiments to confirm these network predictions. Coexpression of genes in large-scale gene-expression data implies coregulation and potential gene-gene interactions, but provide little information about the direction of influences. Here, we use both time-series data and genetics data to infer directionality of edges in regulatory networks: time-series data contain information about the chronological order of regulatory events and genetics data allow us to map DNA variations to variations at the RNA level. We generate microarray data measuring time-dependent gene-expression levels in 95 genotyped yeast segregants subjected to a drug perturbation. We develop a Bayesian model averaging regression algorithm that incorporates external information from diverse data types to infer regulatory networks from the time-series and genetics data. Our algorithm is capable of generating feedback loops. We show that our inferred network recovers existing and novel regulatory relationships. Following network construction, we generate independent microarray data on selected deletion mutants to prospectively test network predictions. We demonstrate the potential of our network to discover de novo transcription-factor binding sites. Applying our construction method to previously published data demonstrates that our method is competitive with leading network construction algorithms in the literature.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: To identify new candidate therapeutic targets for glioblastoma multiforme, we combined functional genetics and glioblastoma network modeling to identify kinases required for the growth of patient-derived brain tumor-initiating cells (BTIC) but that are dispensable to proliferating human neural stem cells (NSC). This approach yielded BUB1B/BUBR1, a critical mitotic spindle checkpoint player, as the top-scoring glioblastoma lethal kinase. Knockdown of BUB1B inhibited expansion of BTIC isolates, both in vitro and in vivo, without affecting proliferation of NSCs or astrocytes. Mechanistic studies revealed that BUB1B's GLE2p-binding sequence (GLEBS) domain activity is required to suppress lethal kinetochore-microtubule (KT-MT) attachment defects in glioblastoma isolates and genetically transformed cells with altered sister KT dynamics, which likely favor KT-MT instability. These results indicate that glioblastoma tumors have an added requirement for BUB1B to suppress lethal consequences of altered KT function and further suggest that sister KT measurements may predict cancer-specific sensitivity to BUB1B inhibition and perhaps other mitotic targets that affect KT-MT stability.

SIGNIFICANCE: Currently, no effective therapies are available for glioblastoma, the most frequent and aggressive brain tumor. Our results suggest that targeting the GLEBS domain activity of BUB1B may provide a therapeutic window for glioblastoma, as the GLEBS domain is nonessential in untransformed cells. Moreover, the results further suggest that sister KT distances at metaphase may predict sensitivity to anticancer therapeutics targeting KT function.},

abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyze the yet ill-defined relationship of distinct human monocyte subsets with cardiovascular outcomes in a broad patient population at cardiovascular risk. Background: Monocytes, the most abundant immune cell type found in atherosclerotic plaques, are crucial promoters of atherogenesis. Three distinct human monocyte subsets exist: classical CD14++CD16-, intermediate CD14++CD16+, and nonclassical CD14+CD16++ monocytes. Immunomodulation of distinct monocyte subsets has recently been discussed as a new therapeutic avenue in atherosclerosis. Methods: Cardiovascular events in 951 subjects referred for elective coronary angiography were prospectively analyzed. Monocyte subset analysis was performed using flow cytometry, blinded to patients' clinical characteristics, and patients were categorized according to quartiles of total monocyte and monocyte subset counts. The primary endpoint was defined a priori as the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, acute myocardial infarction, or nonhemorrhagic stroke. Endpoint adjudication was done blinded to monocyte subset distribution. Results: During a mean follow-up period of 2.6 ± 1.0 years, 93 patients experienced the primary endpoint. In univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis, counts of total (p = 0.010), classical CD14++CD16- (p = 0.024), and intermediate CD14++CD16+ (p {\textless} 0.001) monocytes predicted the primary endpoint, whereas nonclassical monocytes did not (p = 0.158). After full adjustment for confounders, CD14++CD16+ monocytes remained the only monocyte subset independently related to cardiovascular events (fourth vs. first quartile: hazard ratio: 3.019; 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.315 to 6.928; p = 0.009). Conclusions: CD14++CD16+ monocytes independently predicted cardiovascular events in subjects referred for elective coronary angiography. Future studies will be needed to elucidate whether CD14++CD16+ monocytes may become a target cell population for new therapeutic strategies in atherosclerosis. {\textcopyright} 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

@article{Howie2012,
abstract = {The 1000 Genomes Project and disease-specific sequencing efforts are producing large collections of haplotypes that can be used as reference panels for genotype imputation in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, imputing from large reference panels with existing methods imposes a high computational burden. We introduce a strategy called 'pre-phasing' that maintains the accuracy of leading methods while reducing computational costs. We first statistically estimate the haplotypes for each individual within the GWAS sample (pre-phasing) and then impute missing genotypes into these estimated haplotypes. This reduces the computational cost because (i) the GWAS samples must be phased only once, whereas standard methods would implicitly repeat phasing with each reference panel update, and (ii) it is much faster to match a phased GWAS haplotype to one reference haplotype than to match two unphased GWAS genotypes to a pair of reference haplotypes. We implemented our approach in the MaCH and IMPUTE2 frameworks, and we tested it on data sets from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2), the Genetic Association Information Network (GAIN), the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and the 1000 Genomes Project. This strategy will be particularly valuable for repeated imputation as reference panels evolve.},

The growth of three mutant recombinants, A/Hong Kong/68-ts-1E (H3N2), A/HK/123/77x-ts-1A2 (H1N1) and A2/AA/6/60-ca(H2N2) was studied in 15 g mice. Yields of ts-1E from both lungs and turbinates were ten-fold less than that of a control virus with the same surface antigens. All ts-1E isolates showed evidence of loss of ts phenotype. Ts-1A2 and ca recombinants grew to a much lower titre than those of ts-1E, and revertants were obtained from one ts-1A2 lung isolate and one ca turbinate isolate. In other studies with hamsters, the stability of the ts character of these mutants during replication in the lungs of hamsters has been shown to be correlated with their residual virulence for man (Murphy et al., 1972; Murphy et al., 1974; Richman et al., 1977). The results from the present study suggest that the laboratory mouse is at least as sensitive as the hamster as an in vitro model for the detection of ts revertants.},

K31, Gramella forsetii KT0803, Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 and Bordetella bronchiseptica RB50. In addition to confirming the role of transposable elements in interrupting the assemblies, an association was found between the most fragmented regions and known or predicted genomic islands in these strains. Assembly quality was more strongly related to putative genomic island content than to any other factor examined. We believe this association indicates that draft assemblies are limiting our ability to understand the genomic context of important bacterial adaptations and that the increased effort required for finishing genomes can provide a wealth of information for future studies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To determine whether epigenetic markers predict dimensional ratings of depression in maltreated children. METHOD A genome-wide methylation study was completed using the Illumina 450K BeadChip array in 94 maltreated and 96 healthy nontraumatized children with saliva-derived DNA. The 450K BeadChip does not include any methylation sites in the exact location as sites in candidate genes previously examined in the literature, so a test for replication of prior research findings was not feasible. RESULTS Methylation in 3 genes emerged as genome-wide-significant predictors of depression: DNA-Binding Protein Inhibitor ID-3 (ID3); Glutamate Receptor, Ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) 1 (GRIN1); and Tubulin Polymerization Promoting Protein (TPPP) (p {\textless} 5.0 × 10(-7), all analyses). These genes are all biologically relevant with ID3 involved in the stress response, GRIN1 involved in neural plasticity, and TPPP involved in neural circuitry development. Methylation in CpG sites in candidate genes were not predictors of depression at significance levels corrected for whole genome testing, but maltreated and control children did have significantly different $\beta$ values after Bonferroni correction at multiple methylation sites in these candidate genes (e.g., BDNF, NR3C1, FKBP5). CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that epigenetic changes in ID3, GRIN1, and TPPP genes, in combination with experiences of maltreatment, may confer risk for depression in children. The study adds to a growing body of literature supporting a role for epigenetic mechanisms in the pathophysiology of stress-related psychiatric disorders. Although epigenetic changes are frequently long lasting, they are not necessarily permanent. Consequently, interventions to reverse the negative biological and behavioral sequelae associated with child maltreatment are briefly discussed.},

@article{Nagel2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surveillance plays a vital role in disease detection, but traditional methods of collecting patient data, reporting to health officials, and compiling reports are costly and time consuming. In recent years, syndromic surveillance tools have expanded and researchers are able to exploit the vast amount of data available in real time on the Internet at minimal cost. Many data sources for infoveillance exist, but this study focuses on status updates (tweets) from the Twitter microblogging website.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the interaction between cyberspace message activity, measured by keyword-specific tweets, and real world occurrences of influenza and pertussis. Tweets were aggregated by week and compared to weekly influenza-like illness (ILI) and weekly pertussis incidence. The potential effect of tweet type was analyzed by categorizing tweets into 4 categories: nonretweets, retweets, tweets with a URL Web address, and tweets without a URL Web address.

METHODS: Tweets were collected within a 17-mile radius of 11 US cities chosen on the basis of population size and the availability of disease data. Influenza analysis involved all 11 cities. Pertussis analysis was based on the 2 cities nearest to the Washington State pertussis outbreak (Seattle, WA and Portland, OR). Tweet collection resulted in 161,821 flu, 6174 influenza, 160 pertussis, and 1167 whooping cough tweets. The correlation coefficients between tweets or subgroups of tweets and disease occurrence were calculated and trends were presented graphically.

RESULTS: Correlations between weekly aggregated tweets and disease occurrence varied greatly, but were relatively strong in some areas. In general, correlation coefficients were stronger in the flu analysis compared to the pertussis analysis. Within each analysis, flu tweets were more strongly correlated with ILI rates than influenza tweets, and whooping cough tweets correlated more strongly with pertussis incidence than pertussis tweets. Nonretweets correlated more with disease occurrence than retweets, and tweets without a URL Web address correlated better with actual incidence than those with a URL Web address primarily for the flu tweets.

CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that not only does keyword choice play an important role in how well tweets correlate with disease occurrence, but that the subgroup of tweets used for analysis is also important. This exploratory work shows potential in the use of tweets for infoveillance, but continued efforts are needed to further refine research methods in this field.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The control of Clostridium difficile infection is a major international healthcare priority, hindered by a limited understanding of transmission epidemiology for these bacteria. However, transmission studies of bacterial pathogens are rapidly being transformed by the advent of next generation sequencing. RESULTS: Here we sequence whole C. difficile genomes from 486 cases arising over four years in Oxfordshire. We show that we can estimate the times back to common ancestors of bacterial lineages with sufficient resolution to distinguish whether direct transmission is plausible or not. Time depths were inferred using a within-host evolutionary rate that we estimated at 1.4 mutations per genome per year based on serially isolated genomes. The subset of plausible transmissions was found to be highly associated with pairs of patients sharing time and space in hospital. Conversely, the large majority of pairs of genomes matched by conventional typing and isolated from patients within a month of each other were too distantly related to be direct transmissions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that nosocomial transmission between symptomatic C. difficile cases contributes far less to current rates of infection than has been widely assumed, which clarifies the importance of future research into other transmission routes, such as from asymptomatic carriers. With the costs of DNA sequencing rapidly falling and its use becoming more and more widespread, genomics will revolutionize our understanding of the transmission of bacterial pathogens.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The clinical management of H5N1 influenza virus infection in humans remains unclear. Combination chemotherapy with drugs that target different viral proteins might be more effective than monotherapy.

METHODS:BALB/c mice were treated by oral gavage for 5 days with amantadine (1.5, 15 or 30 mg/kg/day) and oseltamivir (1 or 10 mg/kg/day) separately or in combination. Mice were challenged 24 h after initiation of treatment with 10 mouse 50{\%} lethal doses of either amantadine-sensitive (having S31 in the M2 protein) or amantadine-resistant (having N31 in the M2 protein) recombinant A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) virus.

RESULTS:Combination treatment with amantadine (15 or 30 mg/kg/day) and oseltamivir (10 mg/kg/day) provided greater protection (60{\%} and 90{\%}, respectively) against lethal infection with amantadine-sensitive H5N1 virus than did monotherapy. Moreover, spread of the virus to the brain was prevented by both combination regimens. The efficacy of the drug combinations against amantadine-resistant H5N1 virus was comparable to that of oseltamivir alone. Oseltamivir produced a dose-dependent effect against both recombinant H5N1 viruses (P {\textless} 0.05) but did not provide complete protection against lethal infection. Importantly, no mutations in the HA, NA and M2 proteins were detected when the two drugs were used in combination.

CONCLUSIONS:Combination chemotherapy provided a survival advantage over single-agent treatment of mice inoculated with neurotropic H5N1 influenza virus. This strategy might be an option for the control of pandemic influenza viruses that are sensitive to amantadine. Combinations that include other drugs should be explored.},

We developed an economic computer simulation model to determine the costs attributable to healthcare-acquired C. difficile infection (CDI) from the hospital, third-party payer and societal perspectives. Sensitivity analyses explored the effects of varying the cost of hospitalization, C. difficile-attributable length of stay, and the probability of initial and secondary recurrences. The median cost of a case ranged from {\$}9179 to {\$}11 456 from the hospital perspective, {\$}8932 to {\$}11 679 from the third-party payor perspective, and {\$}13 310 to {\$}16 464 from the societal perspective. Most of the costs incurred were accrued during a patient's primary CDI episode. Hospitals with an incidence of 4.1 CDI cases per 100 000 discharges would incur costs {\textgreater}/={\$}3.2 million (hospital perspective); an incidence of 10.5 would lead to costs {\textgreater}/={\$}30.6 million. Our model suggests that the annual US economic burden of CDI would be {\textgreater}/={\$}496 million (hospital perspective), {\textgreater}/={\$}547 million (third-party payer perspective) and {\textgreater}/={\$}796 million (societal perspective). Our results show that C. difficile infection is indeed costly, not only to third-party payers and the hospital, but to society as well. These results are consistent with current literature citing C. difficile as a costly disease.},

abstract = {Given a sample of genome sequences from an asexual population, can one predict its evolutionary future? Here we demonstrate that the branching pattern of reconstructed genealogical trees contains information about the relative fitness of the sampled sequences and that this information can be used to infer the closest extant relative of future populations. Our approach is based on the assumption that evolution proceeds predominantly by accumulation of small effect mutations and does not require any species specific input. Hence, the resulting inference algorithm can be applied to any asexual population under persistent selection pressure. We demonstrate its performance using historical data on seasonal influenza A/H3N2 virus. We predict the progenitor lineage of the upcoming influenza season with near optimal performance in 30{\%} of cases and makes informative predictions in 16 out of 18 years. Beyond providing a practical tool for prediction, our results suggest that continuous adaptation by small effect mutations is a major component of influenza virus evolution.},

abstract = {Human gene expression traits have been shown to be dependent on gender, age and time of day in blood and other tissues. However, other factors that may impact gene expression have not been systematically explored. For example, in studies linking blood gene expression to obesity related traits, whether the fasted or fed state will be the most informative is an open question. Here, we employed a two-arm cross-over design to perform a genome-wide survey of gene expression in human peripheral blood to address explicitly this type of question. We were able to distinguish expression changes due to individual and time-specific effects from those due to food intake. We demonstrate that the transcriptional response to food intake is robust by constructing a classifier from the gene expression traits with {\textgreater}90{\%} accuracy classifying individuals as being in the fasted or fed state. Gene expression traits that were best able to discriminate the fasted and fed states were more heritable and achieved greater coherence with respect to pathways associated with metabolic traits. The connectivity structure among gene expression traits was explored in the context of coexpression networks. Changes in the connectivity structure were observed between the fasted and fed states. We demonstrate that differential expression and differential connectivity are two complementary ways to characterize changes between fasted and fed states. Both gene sets were significantly enriched for genes associated with obesity related traits. Our results suggest that the pair of fasted/fed blood expression profiles provide more comprehensive information about an individual's metabolic states.},

abstract = {Co-expression analysis has been employed to predict gene function, identify functional modules, and determine tumor subtypes. Previous co-expression analysis was mainly conducted at bulk tissue level. It is unclear whether co-expression analysis at the single-cell level will provide novel insights into transcriptional regulation. Here we developed a computational approach to compare glioblastoma expression profiles at the single-cell level with those obtained from bulk tumors. We found that the co-expressed genes observed in single cells and bulk tumors have little overlap and show distinct characteristics. The co-expressed genes identified in bulk tumors tend to have similar biological functions, and are enriched for intrachromosomal interactions with synchronized promoter activity. In contrast, single-cell co-expressed genes are enriched for known protein-protein interactions, and are regulated through interchromosomal interactions. Moreover, gene members of some protein complexes are co-expressed only at the bulk level, while those of other complexes are co-expressed at both single-cell and bulk levels. Finally, we identified a set of co-expressed genes that can predict the survival of glioblastoma patients. Our study highlights that comparative analyses of single-cell and bulk gene expression profiles enable us to identify functional modules that are regulated at different levels and hold great translational potential.},

abstract = {Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (MIC of 4 to 8 $\mu$g/ml) are referred to as vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA). In this study, we characterized two isogenic USA300 S. aureus isolates collected sequentially from a single patient with endocarditis where the S. aureus isolate changed from being susceptible to vancomycin (VSSA) (1 $\mu$g/ml) to VISA (8 $\mu$g/ml). In addition, the VISA isolate lost beta-lactamase activity and showed increased resistance to daptomycin and linezolid. The two strains did not differ in growth rate, but the VISA isolate had a thickened cell wall and was less autolytic. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis comparing the two isolates grown to late exponential phase showed significant differences in transcription of cell surface protein genes (spa, SBI [second immunoglobulin-binding protein of S. aureus], and fibrinogen-binding proteins), regulatory genes (agrBCA, RNAIII, sarT, and saeRS), and others. Using whole-genome shotgun resequencing, we identified 6 insertion/deletion mutations between the VSSA and VISA isolates. A protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) family phosphatase had a 6-bp (nonframeshift) insertion mutation in a highly conserved metal binding domain. Complementation of the clinical VISA isolate with a wild-type copy of the PP2C gene reduced the vancomycin and daptomycin MICs and increased autolytic activity, suggesting that this gene contributed to the reduced vancomycin susceptibility phenotype acquired in vivo. Creation of de novo mutants from the VSSA strain resulted in different mutations, demonstrating that reduced susceptibility to vancomycin in USA300 strains can occur via multiple routes, highlighting the complex nature of the VISA phenotype.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: GenBank flatfile (GBF) format is one of the most popular sequence file formats because of its detailed sequence features and ease of readability. To use the data in the file by a computer, a parsing process is required and is performed according to a given grammar for the sequence and the description in a GBF. Currently, several parser libraries for the GBF have been developed. However, with the accumulation of DNA sequence information from eukaryotic chromosomes, parsing a eukaryotic genome sequence with these libraries inevitably takes a long time, due to the large GBF file and its correspondingly large genomic nucleotide sequence and related feature information. Thus, there is significant need to develop a parsing program with high speed and efficient use of system memory.

RESULTS: We developed a library, GBParsy, which was C language-based and parses GBF files. The parsing speed was maximized by using content-specified functions in place of regular expressions that are flexible but slow. In addition, we optimized an algorithm related to memory usage so that it also increased parsing performance and efficiency of memory usage. GBParsy is at least 5-100x faster than current parsers in benchmark tests.

CONCLUSION: GBParsy is estimated to extract annotated information from almost 100 Mb of a GenBank flatfile for chromosomal sequence information within a second. Thus, it should be used for a variety of applications such as on-time visualization of a genome at a web site.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are at increased risk for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) acquisition. Outbreaks may be difficult to identify due in part to limitations in current molecular genotyping available in clinical practice. Comparison of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may identify epidemiologically distinct isolates among a population sample that appears homogenous when evaluated using conventional typing methods. OBJECTIVE To investigate a putative MRSA outbreak in a NICU utilizing whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis to identify recent transmission events. DESIGN Clinical and surveillance specimens collected during clinical care and outbreak investigation. PATIENTS A total of 17 neonates hospitalized in a 43-bed level III NICU in northeastern Florida from December 2010 to October 2011 were included in this study. METHODS We assessed epidemiological data in conjunction with 4 typing methods: antibiograms, PFGE, spa types, and phylogenetic analysis of genome-wide SNPs. RESULTS Among the 17 type USA300 isolates, 4 different spa types were identified using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Phylogenetic analysis identified 5 infants as belonging to 2 clusters of epidemiologically linked cases and excluded 10 unlinked cases from putative transmission events. The availability of these results during the initial investigation would have improved infection control interventions. CONCLUSION Whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis are invaluable tools for epidemic investigation; they identify transmission events and exclude cases mistakenly implicated by traditional typing methods. When routinely applied to surveillance and investigation in the clinical setting, this approach may provide actionable intelligence for measured, appropriate, and effective interventions.},

abstract = {Bioreactor cell and tissue culture vessels can be used to study bone development in a simulated microgravity environment. These vessels will also provide an advantageous, low maintenance culture system on space station Freedom. Although many types of cells and tissues can potentially utilize this system, our particular interest is in developing bone tissue. We have characterized an organ culture system utilizing embryonic mouse pre-metatarsal mesenchyme, documenting morphogenesis and differentiation as cartilage rods are formed, with subsequent terminal chondrocyte differentiation to hypertrophied cells. Further development to form bone tissue is achieved by supplementation of the culture medium. Research using pre-metatarsal tissue, combined with the bioreactor culture hardware, could give insight into the advantages and/or disadvantages of conditions experienced in microgravity. Studies such as these have the potential to enhance understanding of bone development and adult bone physiology, and may help define the processes of bone demineralization experienced in space and in pathological conditions here on earth.},

abstract = {Replication of a virulent clone (7a) of the reassortant influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34-A/England/939/69 (H3N2) in ferret nasal turbinate tissue is less affected than that of an attenuated clone (64d) by temperatures which occur during pyrexia in ferrets. This is a factor which contributes to the difference in virulence of the two clones. The differential replication of the two clones at pyrexial temperatures has been reproduced in allantois-on-shell (egg-bit) cultures, and the synthesis of viral polypeptides and RNA species examined. This virus-host system was chosen because it was more convenient to use than organ cultures but, like the latter, might provide information relevant to the in vivo situation. With this system it was not possible to achieve single cycle replication: the observed effects are cumulative over several (2 to 3) cycles of replication (24 h) and therefore conclusions from them may not be as definitive as those from single cycle conditions. However, in cells infected with clone 64d both A(+) cRNA and polypeptide synthesis were little affected at 40 degrees C but levels were decreased by about 70-80{\%} at 41 degrees C; A(+) cRNA and polypeptide levels were unaffected even at 41 degrees C with clone 7a. These reductions seem insufficient to account for the 10-fold reduction in infectious yields of clone 64d at 40 degrees C or the 100-fold and 10-fold reductions in yields of clones 64d and 7a respectively at 41 degrees C. There was no evidence of increased production of non-infectious virus at elevated temperatures by either clone. Levels of vRNA were considerably reduced at 40 and 41 degrees C for both clones, but the levels were considerably greater at all temperatures in clone 7a-infected cells than in those infected with clone 64d; vRNA levels were higher for clone 7a at 41 degrees C than for clone 64d at 37 degrees C. The different levels of vRNA do not reflect differences in the availability of template A(-) cRNAs since levels of these were similar for both clones at 37 and 40 degrees C and only reduced for clone 64d at 41 degrees C. Although the interpretation of these data is complicated by multiple cycles of replication it appears that limited availability of vRNA could be an important constraint on the ability of clone 64d to replicate at pyrexial temperatures.},

abstract = {Dengue virus is a worldwide-distributed mosquito-borne flavivirus with a positive strand RNA genome. Its transcribed polyprotein is cleaved by host- and virus-encoded peptidases into 10 proteins, some of which are of unknown function. Although dengue virus-infected cells seem to be resistant to the antiviral action of IFN, the viral products that mediate this resistance are unknown. Therefore, we have analyzed the ability of the 10 dengue virus-encoded proteins to antagonize the IFN response. We found that expression in human A549 cells of the dengue virus nonstructural proteins NS2A, NS4A, or NS4B enhances replication of an IFN-sensitive virus. Moreover, expression of NS4B and, to a lesser extent, of NS2A and NS4A proteins results in down-regulation of IFN-beta-stimulated gene expression. Cells expressing NS4B or infected with dengue virus do not exhibit nuclear signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 on treatment with IFN-beta or IFN-gamma, indicating that NS4B might be involved in blocking IFN signaling during dengue virus infections. This protein, encoded by a positive strand RNA virus, is implicated as an IFN-signaling inhibitor.},

abstract = {Chronic hepatitis C affects an estimated 170 million persons worldwide and due to shared transmission routes many persons are coinfected with HIV. Since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy, HIV patients have longer life expectancy and are suffering fewer AIDS-related complications. The result has been an increase in morbidity and mortality from HIV-associated non-AIDS condition, with high rates of liver related deaths resulting from HCV in the coinfected population. Coinfection with HIV is an independent predictor of liver disease progression, and proper staging of fibrosis is of critical importance in the coinfected patient. In contrast to HIV, it is possible to eradicate HCV infection; and undetectable viral load 12 weeks after cessation of therapy, or sustained viral response (SVR), is considered a clinical cure. As achievement of SVR has been associated with significantly reduced mortality from liver disease and liver disease complications, it is imperative that patients coinfected with HIV/HCV receive therapy for their HCV infection. The length of therapy with previously available interferon-based regimens added a significant burden to HIV/HCV co-infected patients. Newer all-oral, interferon-free regimens promise to simplify treatment regimens, reduce side-effect profiles, and demonstrate reduced drug interactions with numerous HAART regimens.},

Two groups of dengue-immune sera were compared: 32 dengue antibody positive serum specimens from children who subsequently developed asymptomatic secondary dengue infections; and 9 dengue antibody positive serum specimens from children who subsequently developed severe symptomatic secondary dengue infections, 8 of which were clinically diagnosed as dengue hemorrhagic fever. Antibody-dependent enhancement of virus growth was quantitated by measurement of virus yields in supernatant fluids of normal human monocyte cultures that were infected with DEN-2 virus in the presence of undiluted test serum. Only 4 of 32 (12{\%}) preinfection sera from asymptomatic children, but 6 of 9 (67{\%}) preinfection sera from symptomatic children, had significant enhancing activity (P less than 0.001). High serum DEN-2 antibody dependent enhancing activity is a significant (relative risk = 6.2) risk factor for severe illness among children in a dengue hemorrhagic fever endemic region. Dengue antibodies can be neutralizing and therefore protective, or they can be enhancing and increase the risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever.},

abstract = {Characterizing the cellular factors that play a role in the HIV replication cycle is fundamental to fully understanding mechanisms of viral replication and pathogenesis. Whole-genome small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens have identified positive and negative regulators of HIV replication, providing starting points for investigating new cellular factors. We report here that silencing of the deubiquitinase cylindromatosis protein (CYLD), increases HIV infection by enhancing HIV long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven transcription via the NF-$\kappa$B pathway. CYLD is highly expressed in CD4(+) T lymphocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, and dendritic cells. We found that CYLD silencing increases HIV replication in T cell lines. We confirmed the positive role of CYLD silencing in HIV infection in primary human CD4(+) T cells, in which CYLD protein was partially processed upon activation. Lastly, Jurkat T cells latently infected with HIV (JLat cells) were more responsive to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) reactivation in the absence of CYLD, indicating that CYLD activity could play a role in HIV reactivation from latency. In summary, we show that CYLD acts as a potent negative regulator of HIV mRNA expression by specifically inhibiting NF-$\kappa$B-driven transcription. These findings suggest a function for this protein in modulating productive viral replication as well as in viral reactivation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIMPORTANCE: HIV transcription is regulated by a number of host cell factors. Here we report that silencing of the lysine 63 deubiquitinase CYLD increases HIV transcription in an NF-$\kappa$B-dependent manner. We show that CYLD is expressed in HIV target cells and that its silencing increases HIV infection in transformed T cell lines as well as primary CD4(+) T cells. Similarly, reactivation of latent provirus was facilitated in the absence of CYLD. These data suggest that CYLD, which is highly expressed in CD4(+) T cells, can control HIV transcription in productive infection as well as during reactivation from latency.},

abstract = {An important step in 'metagenomics' analysis is the assembly of multiple genomes from mixed sequence reads of multiple species in a microbial community. Most conventional pipelines use a single-genome assembler with carefully optimized parameters. A limitation of a single-genome assembler for de novo metagenome assembly is that sequences of highly abundant species are likely misidentified as repeats in a single genome, resulting in a number of small fragmented scaffolds. We extended a single-genome assembler for short reads, known as 'Velvet', to metagenome assembly, which we called 'MetaVelvet', for mixed short reads of multiple species. Our fundamental concept was to first decompose a de Bruijn graph constructed from mixed short reads into individual sub-graphs, and second, to build scaffolds based on each decomposed de Bruijn sub-graph as an isolate species genome. We made use of two features, the coverage (abundance) difference and graph connectivity, for the decomposition of the de Bruijn graph. For simulated datasets, MetaVelvet succeeded in generating significantly higher N50 scores than any single-genome assemblers. MetaVelvet also reconstructed relatively low-coverage genome sequences as scaffolds. On real datasets of human gut microbial read data, MetaVelvet produced longer scaffolds and increased the number of predicted genes.},

abstract = {Background: The emergence of the epidemic Clostridium difficile 027 strain has renewed interest in infection control practices. Aim: To review the effectiveness of different practices to reduce hospital C.difficile infection (CDI) in non-outbreak settings. Methods: Data sources were identified by a MEDLINE search in English and French. The ORION statement was used to extract key data from articles describing interventions to manage CDI. Findings: Twenty-one studies, published between 1982 and December 2013, were reviewed. Most studies were before-after interventions, and a few studies were planned, formal, prospective investigations. The effects of the following single or combined interventions were described: antibiotic management; environmental disinfection and/or cleaning; hand hygiene bathing; surveillance; cohorting; and isolation of infected patients in private rooms. Conclusion: With many methodological weaknesses and some inadequate research reporting, the observed reduction in CDI may not be entirely attributable to interventions. Although infection control programmes involving education and handwashing/gloving protocols were found to have contributed to a reduction in the incidence of CDI, these measures were usually a component of multi-faceted interventions that did not provide for evaluation of the relative impact of each factor. Appropriate environmental disinfection and antibiotic stewardship would appear to offer the most effective benefits.},

RESULTS:Untreated HTB-11 neuroblastoma cells constitutively express BACE-1 and BACE-2 mRNA. Morphine down regulates the expression of BACE-1 and up regulates the expression of BACE-2 in a naloxone antagonizable manner. When HTB-11 cells were treated with L-NAME, a cNOS inhibitor; the effects of morphine were blocked. SNAP (a NO donor) mimicked the effect of morphine. In SH-SY5Y cells, Abeta treated cells show a dose-dependent decrease in NO release, demonstrating that Ab is dose-dependently inhibiting the release of constitutive NO.

CONCLUSIONS:Ab and morphine/NO each inhibit the production of the other. This suggests that a deficiency of basal NO or endogenous morphine may trigger drastically reduced levels of basal NO. The outcome is chronic vasoconstriction and brain hypoperfusion and eventual neuronal death. This novel theorized mechanism for AD supports an increasingly-accepted vascular pathological hypothesis for the disease.},

A vast number of resistance determinants are, however, found in nonpathogenic micro-organisms. The resistance totality in the global microbiota is the antibiotic resistome and includes not only established resistance genes but also genes that have the potential to evolve into resistance elements. We term these proto-resistance genes and hypothesize that they share common ancestry with other functional units known as housekeeping genes. Genomic enzymology is the study of protein structure-function in light of genetic context and evolution of protein superfamilies. This concept is highly applicable to study of antibiotic resistance evolution from proto-resistance elements. In this review, we summarize some of the genomic enzymology evidence for resistance enzymes pointing to common ancestry with genes of other metabolic functions. Genomic enzymology plays a key role in understanding the origins of antibiotic resistance and aids in designing strategies for diagnosis and prevention thereof.},

abstract = {Co-expression networks are routinely used to study human diseases like obesity and diabetes. Systematic comparison of these networks between species has the potential to elucidate common mechanisms that are conserved between human and rodent species, as well as those that are species-specific characterizing evolutionary plasticity. We developed a semi-parametric meta-analysis approach for combining gene-gene co-expression relationships across expression profile datasets from multiple species. The simulation results showed that the semi-parametric method is robust against noise. When applied to human, mouse, and rat liver co-expression networks, our method out-performed existing methods in identifying gene pairs with coherent biological functions. We identified a network conserved across species that highlighted cell-cell signaling, cell-adhesion and sterol biosynthesis as main biological processes represented in genome-wide association study candidate gene sets for blood lipid levels. We further developed a heterogeneity statistic to test for network differences among multiple datasets, and demonstrated that genes with species-specific interactions tend to be under positive selection throughout evolution. Finally, we identified a human-specific sub-network regulated by RXRG, which has been validated to play a different role in hyperlipidemia and Type 2 diabetes between human and mouse. Taken together, our approach represents a novel step forward in integrating gene co-expression networks from multiple large scale datasets to leverage not only common information but also differences that are dataset-specific.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have achieved great success identifying common genetic variants associated with common human diseases. However, to date, the massive amounts of data generated from GWAS have not been maximally leveraged and integrated with other types of data to identify associations beyond those associations that meet the stringent genome-wide significance threshold. Here, we present a novel approach that leverages information from genetics of gene expression studies to identify biological pathways enriched for expression-associated genetic loci associated with disease in publicly available GWAS results. Specifically, we first identify SNPs in population-based human cohorts that associate with the expression of genes (eSNPs) in the metabolically active tissues liver, subcutaneous adipose, and omental adipose. We then use this functionally annotated set of SNPs to investigate pathways enriched for eSNPs associated with disease in publicly available GWAS data. As an example, we tested 110 pathways from the Kyoto Encylopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database and identified 16 pathways enriched for genes corresponding to eSNPs that show evidence of association with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) T2D GWAS. We then replicated these findings in the Diabetes Genetics Replication and Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) study. Many of the pathways identified have been proposed as important candidate pathways for T2D, including the calcium signaling pathway, the PPAR signaling pathway, and TGF-beta signaling. Importantly, we identified other pathways not previously associated with T2D, including the tight junction, complement and coagulation pathway, and antigen processing and presentation pathway. The integration of pathways and eSNPs provides putative functional bridges between GWAS and candidate genes or pathways, thus serving as a potential powerful approach to identifying biological mechanisms underlying GWAS findings.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Many programs for aligning short sequencing reads to a reference genome have been developed in the last 2 years. Most of them are very efficient for short reads but inefficient or not applicable for reads {\textgreater}200 bp because the algorithms are heavily and specifically tuned for short queries with low sequencing error rate. However, some sequencing platforms already produce longer reads and others are expected to become available soon. For longer reads, hashing-based software such as BLAT and SSAHA2 remain the only choices. Nonetheless, these methods are substantially slower than short-read aligners in terms of aligned bases per unit time. RESULTS: We designed and implemented a new algorithm, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment (BWA-SW), to align long sequences up to 1 Mb against a large sequence database (e.g. the human genome) with a few gigabytes of memory. The algorithm is as accurate as SSAHA2, more accurate than BLAT, and is several to tens of times faster than both. AVAILABILITY: http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net},

abstract = {Transmission events are the fundamental building blocks of the dynamics of any infectious disease. Much about the epidemiology of a disease can be learned when these individual transmission events are known or can be estimated. Such estimations are difficult and generally feasible only when detailed epidemiological data are available. The genealogy estimated from genetic sequences of sampled pathogens is another rich source of information on transmission history. Optimal inference of transmission events calls for the combination of genetic data and epidemiological data into one joint analysis. A key difficulty is that the transmission tree, which describes the transmission events between infected hosts, differs from the phylogenetic tree, which describes the ancestral relationships between pathogens sampled from these hosts. The trees differ both in timing of the internal nodes and in topology. These differences become more pronounced when a higher fraction of infected hosts is sampled. We show how the phylogenetic tree of sampled pathogens is related to the transmission tree of an outbreak of an infectious disease, by the within-host dynamics of pathogens. We provide a statistical framework to infer key epidemiological and mutational parameters by simultaneously estimating the phylogenetic tree and the transmission tree. We test the approach using simulations and illustrate its use on an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. The approach unifies existing methods in the emerging field of phylodynamics with transmission tree reconstruction methods that are used in infectious disease epidemiology.},

The Tuberculosis Database (TBDB) is an integrated database providing access to TB genomic data and resources, relevant to the discovery and development of TB drugs, vaccines and biomarkers. The current release of TBDB houses genome sequence data and annotations for 28 different Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains and related bacteria. TBDB stores pre- and post-publication gene-expression data from M. tuberculosis and its close relatives. TBDB currently hosts data for nearly 1500 public tuberculosis microarrays and 260 arrays for Streptomyces. In addition, TBDB provides access to a suite of comparative genomics and microarray analysis software. By bringing together M. tuberculosis genome annotation and gene-expression data with a suite of analysis tools, TBDB (http://www.tbdb.org/) provides a unique discovery platform for TB research.},

abstract = {Influenza A viruses are the causative agents of annual epidemics and occasional pandemics. The pathogenicity of influenza viruses is determined by complex interplay of viral and host factors. While some knowledge exists on viral determinants of pathogenicity, little is known on the host factors involved. Here, we discuss our recent findings on host genetic variations involved in disease outcome. We found that 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus strains (pH1N1) are low pathogenic in BALB/c but display differential pathogenicities in C57BL/6J mice. In contrast, a highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus (HPAIV) strain of the H5N1 subtype isolated from a fatal human case was more virulent in BALB/c than C57BL/6J mice. As a control, we used a seasonal H1N1 influenza virus which showed marginal pathogenicity in both mouse strains. Thus, differences in pH1N1 virulence become visible in C57BL/6J mice, while intrinsic pH1N1 pathogenicity markers are masked in BALB/c mice. Further, increased pH1N1 virulence correlated with a depressed cytokine response in C57BL/6J mice, while increased H5N1 virulence correlated with an elevated proinflammatory cytokine response in BALB/c mice. These findings indicate that disease severity can be strongly regulated by the host genetic background. Moreover, our findings suggest that differential host determinants contribute to the pathogenesis of pH1N1 and human H5N1 influenza viruses. Further studies are needed to identify the responsible viral factors involved in enhanced pH1N1 virulence in C57BL/6J mice. Also, extensive studies are needed to identify and characterize cellular factors regulating pH1N1 or H5N1 susceptibility in a host dependent manner. These observations extend our knowledge on influenza virus pathogenicity and highlight the role of host dependent factors, especially in pH1N1 susceptibility. We propose the C57BL/6J mouse strain as a convenient small animal model to study pH1N1 virulence determinants. Furthermore, the C57BL/6J mouse strain might also represent a suitable model for the assessment of pH1N1 vaccine candidates or the evaluation of antiviral therapies.},

abstract = {A multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme has been developed for Enterococcus faecium. Internal fragments from seven housekeeping genes of 123 epidemiologically unlinked isolates from humans and livestock and 16 human-derived isolates from several outbreaks in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and The Netherlands were analyzed. A total of 62 sequence types were detected in vancomycin-sensitive E. faecium (VSEF) and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VREF) isolates. VSEF isolates were genetically more diverse than VREF isolates. Both VSEF and VREF isolates clustered in host-specific lineages that were similar to the host-specific clustering obtained by amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis. Outbreak isolates from hospitalized humans clustered in a subgroup that was defined by the presence of a unique allele from the housekeeping gene purK and the surface protein gene esp. The MLST results suggest that epidemic lineages of E. faecium emerged recently worldwide, while genetic variation in both VREF and VSEF was created by longer-term recombination. The results show that MLST of E. faecium provides an excellent tool for isolate characterization and long-term epidemiologic analysis.},

Genetic and molecular definition of these three immune hallmarks of cancer offers the opportunity to learn how to deploy specific countermeasures to reverse the situation in favor of the immune system and, eventually, the patient.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Previous studies of drug trials submitted to regulatory authorities have documented selective reporting of both entire trials and favorable results. The objective of this study is to determine the publication rate of efficacy trials submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in approved New Drug Applications (NDAs) and to compare the trial characteristics as reported by the FDA with those reported in publications.

METHODS AND FINDINGS:This is an observational study of all efficacy trials found in approved NDAs for New Molecular Entities (NMEs) from 2001 to 2002 inclusive and all published clinical trials corresponding to the trials within the NDAs. For each trial included in the NDA, we assessed its publication status, primary outcome(s) reported and their statistical significance, and conclusions. Seventy-eight percent (128/164) of efficacy trials contained in FDA reviews of NDAs were published. In a multivariate model, trials with favorable primary outcomes (OR = 4.7, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.33-17.1, p = 0.018) and active controls (OR = 3.4, 95{\%} CI 1.02-11.2, p = 0.047) were more likely to be published. Forty-one primary outcomes from the NDAs were omitted from the papers. Papers included 155 outcomes that were in the NDAs, 15 additional outcomes that favored the test drug, and two other neutral or unknown additional outcomes. Excluding outcomes with unknown significance, there were 43 outcomes in the NDAs that did not favor the NDA drug. Of these, 20 (47{\%}) were not included in the papers. The statistical significance of five of the remaining 23 outcomes (22{\%}) changed between the NDA and the paper, with four changing to favor the test drug in the paper (p = 0.38). Excluding unknowns, 99 conclusions were provided in both NDAs and papers, nine conclusions (9{\%}) changed from the FDA review of the NDA to the paper, and all nine did so to favor the test drug (100{\%}, 95{\%} CI 72{\%}-100{\%}, p = 0.0039).

CONCLUSIONS:Many trials were still not published 5 y after FDA approval. Discrepancies between the trial information reviewed by the FDA and information found in published trials tended to lead to more favorable presentations of the NDA drugs in the publications. Thus, the information that is readily available in the scientific literature to health care professionals is incomplete and potentially biased.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Standard estimates of the impact of Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) on inpatient lengths of stay (LOS) may overstate inpatient care costs attributable to CDI. In this study, we used multistate modeling (MSM) of CDI timing to reduce bias in estimates of excess LOS. METHODS A retrospective cohort study of all hospitalizations at any of 120 acute care facilities within the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) between 2005 and 2012 was conducted. We estimated the excess LOS attributable to CDI using an MSM to address time-dependent bias. Bootstrapping was used to generate 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI). These estimates were compared to unadjusted differences in mean LOS for hospitalizations with and without CDI. RESULTS During the study period, there were 3.96 million hospitalizations and 43,540 CDIs. A comparison of unadjusted means suggested an excess LOS of 14.0 days (19.4 vs 5.4 days). In contrast, the MSM estimated an attributable LOS of only 2.27 days (95{\%} CI, 2.14-2.40). The excess LOS for mild-to-moderate CDI was 0.75 days (95{\%} CI, 0.59-0.89), and for severe CDI, it was 4.11 days (95{\%} CI, 3.90-4.32). Substantial variation across the Veteran Integrated Services Networks (VISN) was observed. CONCLUSIONS CDI significantly contributes to LOS, but the magnitude of its estimated impact is smaller when methods are used that account for the time-varying nature of infection. The greatest impact on LOS occurred among patients with severe CDI. Significant geographic variability was observed. MSM is a useful tool for obtaining more accurate estimates of the inpatient care costs of CDI. Infect. Control Hosp. Epidemiol. 2015;00(0):1-7.},

abstract = {Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (SM) is an important nosocomial pathogen that exhibits intrinsic resistance to various antimicrobial agents. However, the risk factors for SM bacteraemia have not been sufficiently evaluated. From January 2005 to September 2012, we retrospectively compared the clinical backgrounds and outcomes of SM bacteraemic patients (SM group) with those of bacteraemic patients due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA group) or Acinetobacter species (AC group). DNA genotyping of the SM isolates using the Diversilab system was performed to investigate the genetic relationships among the isolates. The SM, PA, and AC groups included 54, 167, and 69 patients, respectively. Nine of 17 patients in the SM group receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis developed SM bacteraemia. Independent risk factors for SM bacteraemia were the use of carbapenems and antipseudomonal cephalosporins and SM isolation within 30 days prior to the onset of bacteraemia. Earlier SM isolation was observed in 32 of 48 patients (66.7{\%}) with SM bacteraemia who underwent clinical microbiological examinations. Of these 32 patients, 15 patients (46.9{\%}) had the same focus of bacteraemia as was found in the previous isolation site. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate among the SM group (33.3{\%}) was higher than that of the PA group (21.5{\%}, p = 0.080) and the AC group (17.3{\%}, p = 0.041). The independent factor that was associated with 30-day mortality was the SOFA score. DNA genotyping of SM isolates and epidemiological data suggested that no outbreak had occurred. SM bacteraemia was associated with high mortality and should be considered in patients with recent use of broad-spectrum antibiotics or in patients with recent isolation of the organism.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Patterns of disease incidence can identify new risk factors for the disease or provide insight into the etiology. For example, allergies and infectious diseases have been shown to follow periodic temporal patterns due to seasonal changes in environmental or infectious agents. Previous work searching for seasonal or other temporal patterns in disease diagnosis rates has been limited both in the scope of the diseases examined and in the ability to distinguish unexpected seasonal patterns. Electronic Health Records (EHR) compile extensive longitudinal clinical information, constituting a unique source for discovery of trends in occurrence of disease. However, the data suffer from inherent biases that preclude an identification of temporal trends.METHODS:Motivated by observation of the biases in this data source, we developed a method (Lomb-Scargle periodograms in detrended data, LSP-detrend) to find periodic patterns by adjusting the temporal information for broad trends in incidence, as well as seasonal changes in total hospitalizations. LSP-detrend can sensitively uncover periodic temporal patterns in the corrected data and identify the significance of the trend. We apply LSP-detrend to a compilation of records from 1.5 million patients encoded by ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification), including 2,805 disorders with more than 500 occurrences across a 12 year period, recorded from 1.5 million patients.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:Although EHR data, and ICD-9 coded records in particular, were not created with the intention of aggregated use for research, these data can in fact be mined for periodic patterns in incidence of disease, if confounders are properly removed. Of all diagnoses, around 10{\%} are identified as seasonal by LSP-detrend, including many known phenomena. We robustly reproduce previous findings, even for relatively rare diseases. For instance, Kawasaki disease, a rare childhood disease that has been associated with weather patterns, is detected as strongly linked with winter months. Among the novel results, we find a bi-annual increase in exacerbations of myasthenia gravis, a potentially life threatening complication of an autoimmune disease. We dissect the causes of this seasonal incidence and propose that factors predisposing patients to this event vary through the year.},

abstract = {Given large sample sizes, whole genome screens are now able to identify even quite modest contributions of common human genetic variation to disease. These approaches, made possible by the development of high-throughput, dense SNP genotyping, find few associations stronger than those for the human MHC, in multigenic autoimmune conditions. They confirm earlier findings that the major variants affecting susceptibility and resistance to autoimmunity relate to MHC class I and class II genes. It is generally assumed, although there are few good examples, that selection for resistance to infection drives evolution of MHC variation. Many MHC-associated diseases may be the price paid for an effective immune response. Interestingly, the MHC appears to influence susceptibility to conditions unrelated to immunity, including some neuropathologies. The infectious history of the individual, conditioned by their MHC, may exert an indirect effect on these diseases, although there are hints of more direct involvement of MHC molecules in neuronal systems. Here I survey the variety of conditions associated with the MHC in relation to ideas that selection through disease resistance is dependent upon MHC variation, not only at the level of the individual, but also at the level of the population.},

abstract = {The 1000 Genomes Project aims to provide a deep characterization of human genome sequence variation as a foundation for investigating the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Here we present results of the pilot phase of the project, designed to develop and compare different strategies for genome-wide sequencing with high-throughput platforms. We undertook three projects: low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 179 individuals from four populations; high-coverage sequencing of two mother-father-child trios; and exon-targeted sequencing of 697 individuals from seven populations. We describe the location, allele frequency and local haplotype structure of approximately 15 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1 million short insertions and deletions, and 20,000 structural variants, most of which were previously undescribed. We show that, because we have catalogued the vast majority of common variation, over 95{\%} of the currently accessible variants found in any individual are present in this data set. On average, each person is found to carry approximately 250 to 300 loss-of-function variants in annotated genes and 50 to 100 variants previously implicated in inherited disorders. We demonstrate how these results can be used to inform association and functional studies. From the two trios, we directly estimate the rate of de novo germline base substitution mutations to be approximately 10(-8) per base pair per generation. We explore the data with regard to signatures of natural selection, and identify a marked reduction of genetic variation in the neighbourhood of genes, due to selection at linked sites. These methods and public data will support the next phase of human genetic research.},

abstract = {Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) manifests as phenotypically and functionally diverse cells, often within the same patient. Intratumor phenotypic and functional heterogeneity have been linked primarily by physical sorting experiments, which assume that functionally distinct subpopulations can be prospectively isolated by surface phenotypes. This assumption has proven problematic, and we therefore developed a data-driven approach. Using mass cytometry, we profiled surface and intracellular signaling proteins simultaneously in millions of healthy and leukemic cells. We developed PhenoGraph, which algorithmically defines phenotypes in high-dimensional single-cell data. PhenoGraph revealed that the surface phenotypes of leukemic blasts do not necessarily reflect their intracellular state. Using hematopoietic progenitors, we defined a signaling-based measure of cellular phenotype, which led to isolation of a gene expression signature that was predictive of survival in independent cohorts. This study presents new methods for large-scale analysis of single-cell heterogeneity and demonstrates their utility, yielding insights into AML pathophysiology.},

@article{Dickerson2007,
abstract = {Ligand-binding epitopes of proteins can mutate rapidly, as shown by viral mutations that lead to escape from neutralizing antibodies. We have undertaken to recreate in vitro the evolutionary competition between viral mutations that allow escape from antibody binding and host mutations that generate new neutralizing antibodies to the mutated viral antigen. To examine this vital race, we describe a phage-based method that allows rapid analysis of molecules that perturb the binding of proteins to their ligands. Because the system can amplify by replication, single-molecule sensitivity can be achieved. When combinatorial protein or small-molecule libraries are studied, large numbers of binding events can be analyzed simultaneously. Such libraries may be used in a sequential phage escape format, where cycles of phage binding and release of mutants are driven by antibodies or small molecules and the difficulty of escape increases at each cycle. Ultimately, the sequencing of the viral mutants allows annotation of the allowed trajectory of escape. Likewise, sequencing of the antibody perturbants charts the chemistry of the immune system response to the viral challenge. We have termed such analysis of competing mutations a "checkmate analysis." When viral systems are studied, a checkmate analysis allows experimental evaluation of the evolutionary contest between viruses and the immune system and may predict which antibodies and small-molecule ligands should be generated in anticipation of viral mutations before these mutations create viral epidemics.},

The mutant virus finally selected was stable and differed from the original virus mainly in lethality upon intraperitoneal injection in mice, in its ability to grow to high titers in livers of susceptible animals and in plaque morphology in chick embryo fibroblasts. No differences were detected in hemagglutination inhibition and neutralization by standard mouse antisera. Pathogenicity for the liver was independent of the route of inoculation, included other laboratory animals sensitive to influenza virus and could be inhibited by amantadine. Fatal hepatitis in 50 per cent of susceptible mice by the intraperitoneal route required from 10 to 20 EID50-. Pathological changes consisted of severe necrosis of liver parenchyma accompanied by release of F antigen into the serum and were apparently due to virus replication in hepatic cells as evidenced by immunofluorescence.

abstract = {Gene co-expression network analysis has been shown effective in identifying functional co-expressed gene modules associated with complex human diseases. However, existing techniques to construct co-expression networks require some critical prior information such as predefined number of clusters, numerical thresholds for defining co-expression/interaction, or do not naturally reproduce the hallmarks of complex systems such as the scale-free degree distribution of small-worldness. Previously, a graph filtering technique called Planar Maximally Filtered Graph (PMFG) has been applied to many real-world data sets such as financial stock prices and gene expression to extract meaningful and relevant interactions. However, PMFG is not suitable for large-scale genomic data due to several drawbacks, such as the high computation complexity O(|V|3), the presence of false-positives due to the maximal planarity constraint, and the inadequacy of the clustering framework. Here, we developed a new co-expression network analysis framework called Multiscale Embedded Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (MEGENA) by: i) introducing quality control of co-expression similarities, ii) parallelizing embedded network construction, and iii) developing a novel clustering technique to identify multi-scale clustering structures in Planar Filtered Networks (PFNs). We applied MEGENA to a series of simulated data and the gene expression data in breast carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). MEGENA showed improved performance over well-established clustering methods and co-expression network construction approaches. MEGENA revealed not only meaningful multi-scale organizations of co-expressed gene clusters but also novel targets in breast carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Novel influenza A viruses of the H7N9 subtype [A(H7N9)] emerged in the spring of 2013 in China and had infected 163 people as of 10 January 2014; 50 of them died of the severe respiratory infection caused by these viruses. Phylogenetic studies have indicated that the novel A(H7N9) viruses emerged from reassortment of H7, N9, and H9N2 viruses. Inspections of protein sequences from A(H7N9) viruses and their immediate predecessors revealed several amino acid changes in A(H7N9) viruses that may have facilitated transmission and replication in the novel host. Since mutations that occurred more ancestrally may also have contributed to the genesis of A(H7N9) viruses, we inferred historical evolutionary events leading to the novel viruses. We identified a number of amino acid changes on the evolutionary path to A(H7N9) viruses, including substitutions that may be associated with host range, replicative ability, and/or host responses to infection. The biological significance of these amino acid changes can be tested in future studies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIMPORTANCE: The novel influenza A viruses of the H7N9 subtype [A(H7N9)], which first emerged in the spring of 2013, cause severe respiratory infections in humans. Here, we performed a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of the progenitors of A(H7N9) viruses to identify amino acid changes that may have been critical for the emergence of A(H7N9) viruses and their ability to infect humans. We provide a list of potentially important amino acid changes that can be tested for their significance for the influenza virus host range, replicative ability, and/or host responses to infection.},

abstract = {Background: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) remains an infection control challenge, especially when environmental spore contamination and suboptimal cleaning may increase transmission risk. Aim: To substantiate the long-term effectiveness throughout a stroke rehabilitation unit (SRU) of deep cleaning and hydrogen peroxide decontamination (HPD), following a high incidence of CDI. Methods: Extensive environmental sampling (342 sites on each occasion) for C.difficile using sponge wipes was performed: before and after deep cleaning with detergent/chlorine agent; immediately following HPD; and on two further occasions, 19 days and 20 weeks following HPD. C.difficile isolates underwent polymerase chain reaction ribotyping and multi-locus variable repeat analysis (MLVA). Findings: C.difficile was recovered from 10.8{\%}, 6.1{\%}, 0.9{\%}, 0{\%} and 3.5{\%} of sites at baseline, following deep cleaning, immediately after HPD, and 19 days and 20 weeks after HPD, respectively. C.difficile ribotypes recovered after deep cleaning matched those from CDI cases in the SRU during the previous 10 months. Similarly, 10/12 of the positive sites identified at 20 weeks post-HPD harboured the same C.difficile ribotype (002) and MLVA pattern as the isolate from the first post-HPD CDI case. CDI incidence [number of cases on SRU per 10 months (January-October 2011)] declined from 20 before to seven after the intervention. Conclusion: HPD, after deep cleaning with a detergent/chlorine agent, was highly effective for removing environmental C.difficile contamination. Long-term follow-up demonstrated that a CDI symptomatic patient can rapidly recontaminate the immediate environment. Determining a role for HPD should include long-term cost-effectiveness evaluations. ?? 2014 The Healthcare Infection Society.},

abstract = {Although the majority of bacteria are harmless or even beneficial to their host, others are highly virulent and can cause serious diseases, and even death. Due to the constantly decreasing cost of high-throughput sequencing there are now many completely sequenced genomes available from both human pathogenic and innocuous strains. The data can be used to identify gene families that correlate with pathogenicity and to develop tools to predict the pathogenicity of newly sequenced strains, investigations that previously were mainly done by means of more expensive and time consuming experimental approaches. We describe PathogenFinder (http://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/PathogenFinder/), a web-server for the prediction of bacterial pathogenicity by analysing the input proteome, genome, or raw reads provided by the user. The method relies on groups of proteins, created without regard to their annotated function or known involvement in pathogenicity. The method has been built to work with all taxonomic groups of bacteria and using the entire training-set, achieved an accuracy of 88.6{\%} on an independent test-set, by correctly classifying 398 out of 449 completely sequenced bacteria. The approach here proposed is not biased on sets of genes known to be associated with pathogenicity, thus the approach could aid the discovery of novel pathogenicity factors. Furthermore the pathogenicity prediction web-server could be used to isolate the potential pathogenic features of both known and unknown strains.},

A key characteristic of IGV is its focus on the integrative nature of genomic studies, with support for both array-based and next-generation sequencing data, and the integration of clinical and phenotypic data. Although IGV is often used to view genomic data from public sources, its primary emphasis is to support researchers who wish to visualize and explore their own data sets or those from colleagues. To that end, IGV supports flexible loading of local and remote data sets, and is optimized to provide high-performance data visualization and exploration on standard desktop systems.

However, accurate resolution of large structural events is challenging because of the short read lengths of second-generation technologies. Third-generation sequencing technologies, which can yield longer multikilobase reads, have the potential to address limitations associated with genome assembly. Here we combine sequencing data from second- and third-generation DNA sequencing technologies to assemble the two-chromosome genome of a recent Haitian cholera outbreak strain into two nearly finished contigs at {\textgreater}99.9{\%} accuracy. Complex regions with clinically relevant structure were completely resolved. In separate control assemblies on experimental and simulated data for the canonical N16961 cholera reference strain, we obtained 14 scaffolds of greater than 1 kb for the experimental data and 8 scaffolds of greater than 1 kb for the simulated data, which allowed us to correct several errors in contigs assembled from the short-read data alone.

@book{Hastie2009a,
abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression {\&} path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates.},

@article{Meyer2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Random community genomes (metagenomes) are now commonly used to study microbes in different environments. Over the past few years, the major challenge associated with metagenomics shifted from generating to analyzing sequences. High-throughput, low-cost next-generation sequencing has provided access to metagenomics to a wide range of researchers. RESULTS: A high-throughput pipeline has been constructed to provide high-performance computing to all researchers interested in using metagenomics. The pipeline produces automated functional assignments of sequences in the metagenome by comparing both protein and nucleotide databases. Phylogenetic and functional summaries of the metagenomes are generated, and tools for comparative metagenomics are incorporated into the standard views. User access is controlled to ensure data privacy, but the collaborative environment underpinning the service provides a framework for sharing datasets between multiple users. In the metagenomics RAST, all users retain full control of their data, and everything is available for download in a variety of formats. CONCLUSION: The open-source metagenomics RAST service provides a new paradigm for the annotation and analysis of metagenomes. With built-in support for multiple data sources and a back end that houses abstract data types, the metagenomics RAST is stable, extensible, and freely available to all researchers. This service has removed one of the primary bottlenecks in metagenome sequence analysis - the availability of high-performance computing for annotating the data. http://metagenomics.nmpdr.org.},

Using a mouse model of CHIKV arthritis and myositis, we show that tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$, interferon-$\gamma$, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) were dramatically induced in tissues from infected mice. The same factors were detected in the serum of patients with CHIKV-induced polyarthralgia and polyarthritis, with MCP-1 levels being particularly elevated. Bindarit (MCP inhibitor) treatment ameliorated CHIKV disease in mice. Histological analysis of muscle and joint tissues showed a reduction in inflammatory infiltrate in infected mice treated with bindarit. These results suggest that bindarit may be useful in treating CHIKV-induced arthritides in humans.},

abstract = {Abstract In comparative genomics studies, finding a minimum length sequences of reversals, so-called sorting by reversals, has been the topic of a huge literature. Since there are many minimum length sequences, another important topic has been the problem of listing all parsimonious sequences between two genomes, called the All Sorting Sequences by Reversals (ASSR) problem. In this article, we revisit the ASSR problem for uni-chromosomal genomes when no duplications are allowed and when the relative order of the genes is known. We put the current body of work in perspective by illustrating the fundamental framework that is common for all of them, a perspective that allows us for the first time to theoretically compare their running times. The article also proposes an improved framework that empirically speeds up all known algorithms.},

@article{Blumenthal1997,
abstract = {OBJECTIVES:To identify the prevalence and determinants of data-withholding behaviors among academic life scientists.

DESIGN:Mailed survey of 3394 life science faculty in the 50 universities that received the most funding from the National Institutes of Health in 1993.

PARTICIPANTS:A total of 2167 faculty responded to the survey, a 64{\%} response rate.

OUTCOME MEASURES:Whether respondents delayed publication of their research results for more than 6 months and whether respondents refused to share research results with other university scientists in the last 3 years.

RESULTS:A total of 410 respondents (19.8{\%}) reported that publication of their research results had been delayed by more than 6 months at least once in the last 3 years to allow for patent application, to protect their scientific lead, to slow the dissemination of undesired results, to allow time to negotiate a patent, or to resolve disputes over the ownership of intellectual property. Also, 181 respondents (8.9{\%}) reported refusing to share research results with other university scientists in the last 3 years. In multivariate analysis, participation in an academic-industry research relationship and engagement in the commercialization of university research were significantly associated with delays in publication. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were 1.34 (1.07-1.59) and 3.15 (2.88-3.41), respectively. Variables associated with refusing to share results were conducting research similar to the Human Genome Project (OR, 2.09; 95{\%} CI, 1.75-2.42), publication rate (OR, 1.02; 95{\%} CI, 1.01-1.03), and engagement in commercialization of research (OR, 2.45; 95{\%} CI, 2.08-2.82).

CONCLUSIONS:Withholding of research results is not a widespread phenomenon among life-science researchers. However, withholding is more common among the most productive and entrepreneurial faculty. These results also suggest that data withholding has affected a significant number of life-science faculty and further study on data-withholding practices is suggested.},

ViPR provides access to sequence records, gene and protein annotations, immune epitopes, 3D structures, host factor data, and other data types through an intuitive web-based search interface. Records returned from these queries can then be subjected to web-based analyses including: multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic inference, sequence variation determination, BLAST comparison, and metadata-driven comparative genomics statistical analysis. Additional tools exist to display multiple sequence alignments, view phylogenetic trees, visualize 3D protein structures, transfer existing reference genome annotations to new genomes, and store or share results from any search or analysis within personal private 'Workbench' spaces for future access. All of the data and integrated analysis and visualization tools in ViPR are made available without charge as a service to the Coronaviridae research community to facilitate the research and development of diagnostics, prophylactics, vaccines and therapeutics against these human pathogens.},

abstract = {Network reconstruction algorithms are increasingly being employed in biomedical and life sciences research to integrate large-scale, high-dimensional data informing on living systems. One particular class of probabilistic causal networks being applied to model the complexity and causal structure of biological data is Bayesian networks (BNs). BNs provide an elegant mathematical framework for not only inferring causal relationships among many different molecular and higher order phenotypes, but also for incorporating highly diverse priors that provide an efficient path for incorporating existing knowledge. While significant methodological developments have broadly enabled the application of BNs to generate and validate meaningful biological hypotheses, the reproducibility of BNs in this context has not been systematically explored. In this study, we aim to determine the criteria for generating reproducible BNs in the context of transcription-based regulatory networks. We utilize two unique tissues from independent datasets, whole blood from the GTEx Consortium and liver from the Stockholm-Tartu Atherosclerosis Reverse Network Engineering Team (STARNET) study. We evaluated the reproducibility of the BNs by creating networks on data subsampled at different levels from each cohort and comparing these networks to the BNs constructed using the complete data. To help validate our results, we used simulated networks at varying sample sizes. Our study indicates that reproducibility of BNs in biological research is an issue worthy of further consideration, especially in light of the many publications that now employ findings from such constructs without appropriate attention paid to reproducibility. We find that while edge-to-edge reproducibility is strongly dependent on sample size, identification of more highly connected key driver nodes in BNs can be carried out with high confidence across a range of sample sizes.},

In this review, we describe the current computational approaches for the task, including direct methods, which propagate functional information through the network, and module-assisted methods, which infer functional modules within the network and use those for the annotation task. Although a broad variety of interesting approaches has been developed, further progress in the field will depend on systematic evaluation of the methods and their dissemination in the biological community.},

A time-dependent propensity score based on the Cox proportional hazards model is proposed and used in risk set matching. Matching on this propensity score is shown to achieve a balanced distribution of the covariates in both treated and control groups. Optimal matching with various designs is conducted and compared in a study of a surgical treatment, cystoscopy and hydrodistention, given in response to a chronic bladder disease, interstitial cystitis. Simulation studies also suggest that the statistical analysis after matching outperforms the analysis without matching in terms of both point and interval estimations.},

abstract = {The concept of absorptive capacity was introduced by Cohen and Levinthal in 1989. Since then it has been enhanced through reconceptualizations and extended by various empirical studies. Despite the growing interest in absorptive capacity it is unclear what this large stream of papers has collectively accomplished. The used definitions, antecedents, components and outcomes of the construct are extremely heterogeneous. Due to this heterogeneity, the empirical study of the construct remains difficult. There is no standard measure and no standard method of measurement, which can be used in empirical research. To bring more clarity into this research area, this paper provides a critical review of previous empirical treatments of absorptive capacity. For this purpose, different methods of measurement are classified in the following way: within quantitative methods proxy indicators and perceptive instruments are differentiated. Proxy indicators use single firm-level data for measuring absorptive capacity and can be input-oriented (R{\&}D efforts, R{\&}D human capital) or output-oriented (R{\&}D patents, R{\&}D publications). Perceptive instruments imply that researchers develop single questions or a set of questions, which reflect absorptive capacity or parts of it at the operational level. The main weakness of both proxy indicators and perceptive instruments is that they don't meet the complexity and emergence of the construct. Only few qualitative studies have started to adopt a new perspective, recognizing the process and practice-based character of absorptive capacity. In summary, the critical review prints out the necessity of advancing research in this area. For this reason, we set out to develop an alternative approach to capture absorptive capacity. It is a practice-oriented approach that allows studying actual absorptive practices in real world situations and enables researchers to capture the complex, embedded, and context-dependent patterns of acting.},

abstract = {Bordetella bacteriophages generate diversity in a gene that specifies host tropism. This microevolutionary adaptation is produced by a genetic element that combines the basic retroelement life cycle of transcription, reverse transcription and integration with site-directed, adenine-specific mutagenesis. Central to this process is a reverse transcriptase-mediated exchange between two repeats; one serving as a donor template (TR) and the other as a recipient of variable sequence information (VR). Here we describe the genetic basis for diversity generation. The directionality of information transfer is determined by a 21-base-pair sequence present at the 3' end of VR. On the basis of patterns of marker transfer in response to variant selective pressures, we propose that a TR reverse transcript is mutagenized, integrated into VR as a single non-coding strand, and then partially converted to the parental VR sequence. This allows the diversity-generating system to minimize variability to the subset of bases under selection. Using the Bordetella phage cassette as a signature, we have identified numerous related elements in diverse bacteria. These elements constitute a new family of retroelements with the potential to confer selective advantages to their host genomes.},

abstract = {We present novel optimization-based classification models that are general purpose and suitable for developing predictive rules for large heterogeneous biological and medical data sets. Our predictive model simultaneously incorporates (1) the ability to classify any number of distinct groups; (2) the ability to incorporate heterogeneous types of attributes as input; (3) a high-dimensional data transformation that eliminates noise and errors in biological data; (4) the ability to incorporate constraints to limit the rate of misclassification, and a reserved-judgment region that provides a safeguard against over-training (which tends to lead to high misclassification rates from the resulting predictive rule); and (5) successive multi-stage classification capability to handle data points placed in the reserved-judgment region. To illustrate the power and flexibility of the classification model and solution engine, and its multi-group prediction capability, application of the predictive model to a broad class of biological and medical problems is described. Applications include: the differential diagnosis of the type of erythemato-squamous diseases; predicting presence/absence of heart disease; genomic analysis and prediction of aberrant CpG island meythlation in human cancer; discriminant analysis of motility and morphology data in human lung carcinoma; prediction of ultrasonic cell disruption for drug delivery; identification of tumor shape and volume in treatment of sarcoma; discriminant analysis of biomarkers for prediction of early atherosclerois; fingerprinting of native and angiogenic microvascular networks for early diagnosis of diabetes, aging, macular degeneracy and tumor metastasis; prediction of protein localization sites; and pattern recognition of satellite images in classification of soil types. In all these applications, the predictive model yields correct classification rates ranging from 80 to 100{\%}. This provides motivation for pursuing its use as a medical diagnostic, monitoring and decision-making tool.},

Here we report a genomic analysis of two uncultured marine viral communities. Over 65{\%} of the sequences were not significantly similar to previously reported sequences, suggesting that much of the diversity is previously uncharacterized. The most common significant hits among the known sequences were to viruses. The viral hits included sequences from all of the major families of dsDNA tailed phages, as well as some algal viruses. Several independent mathematical models based on the observed number of contigs predicted that the most abundant viral genome comprised 2-3{\%} of the total population in both communities, which was estimated to contain between 374 and 7,114 viral types. Overall, diversity of the viral communities was extremely high. The results also showed that it would be possible to sequence the entire genome of an uncultured marine viral community.},

@article{Bassler2010,
abstract = {CONTEXT:Theory and simulation suggest that randomized controlled trials (RCTs) stopped early for benefit (truncated RCTs) systematically overestimate treatment effects for the outcome that precipitated early stopping.

OBJECTIVE:To compare the treatment effect from truncated RCTs with that from meta-analyses of RCTs addressing the same question but not stopped early (nontruncated RCTs) and to explore factors associated with overestimates of effect.

DATA SOURCES:Search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents, and full-text journal content databases to identify truncated RCTs up to January 2007; search of MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects to identify systematic reviews from which individual RCTs were extracted up to January 2008.

STUDY SELECTION:Selected studies were RCTs reported as having stopped early for benefit and matching nontruncated RCTs from systematic reviews. Independent reviewers with medical content expertise, working blinded to trial results, judged the eligibility of the nontruncated RCTs based on their similarity to the truncated RCTs.

DATA EXTRACTION:Reviewers with methodological expertise conducted data extraction independently.

RESULTS:The analysis included 91 truncated RCTs asking 63 different questions and 424 matching nontruncated RCTs. The pooled ratio of relative risks in truncated RCTs vs matching nontruncated RCTs was 0.71 (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.65-0.77). This difference was independent of the presence of a statistical stopping rule and the methodological quality of the studies as assessed by allocation concealment and blinding. Large differences in treatment effect size between truncated and nontruncated RCTs (ratio of relative risks {\textless}0.75) occurred with truncated RCTs having fewer than 500 events. In 39 of the 63 questions (62{\%}), the pooled effects of the nontruncated RCTs failed to demonstrate significant benefit.

CONCLUSIONS:Truncated RCTs were associated with greater effect sizes than RCTs not stopped early. This difference was independent of the presence of statistical stopping rules and was greatest in smaller studies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prospects of newly available benchtop sequencers to provide rapid whole-genome data in routine clinical practice. Next-generation sequencing has the potential to resolve uncertainties surrounding the route and timing of person-to-person transmission of healthcare-associated infection, which has been a major impediment to optimal management. DESIGN: The authors used Illumina MiSeq benchtop sequencing to undertake case studies investigating potential outbreaks of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile. SETTING: Isolates were obtained from potential outbreaks associated with three UK hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Isolates were sequenced from a cluster of eight MRSA carriers and an associated bacteraemia case in an intensive care unit, another MRSA cluster of six cases and two clusters of C difficile. Additionally, all C difficile isolates from cases over 6 weeks in a single hospital were rapidly sequenced and compared with local strain sequences obtained in the preceding 3 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Whole-genome genetic relatedness of the isolates within each epidemiological cluster. RESULTS: Twenty-six MRSA and 15 C difficile isolates were successfully sequenced and analysed within 5 days of culture. Both MRSA clusters were identified as outbreaks, with most sequences in each cluster indistinguishable and all within three single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Epidemiologically unrelated isolates of the same spa-type were genetically distinct (≥21 SNVs). In both C difficile clusters, closely epidemiologically linked cases (in one case sharing the same strain type) were shown to be genetically distinct (≥144 SNVs). A reconstruction applying rapid sequencing in C difficile surveillance provided early outbreak detection and identified previously undetected probable community transmission. CONCLUSIONS: This benchtop sequencing technology is widely generalisable to human bacterial pathogens. The findings provide several good examples of how rapid and precise sequencing could transform identification of transmission of healthcare-associated infection and therefore improve hospital infection control and patient outcomes in routine clinical practice.},

abstract = {Given two signed multi-chromosomal genomes $\Pi$ and $\Gamma$ with the same gene set, the problem of sorting by translocations (SBT) is to find a shortest sequence of translocations transforming $\Pi$ to $\Gamma$, where the length of the sequence is called the translocation distance between $\Pi$ and $\Gamma$. In 1996, Hannenhalli gave the formula of the translocation distance for the first time, based on which an O(n 3) algorithm for SBT was given. In 2005, Anne Bergeron et al. revisited this problem and gave an elementary proof for the formula of the translocation distance which leads to a new O(n 3) algorithm for SBT. In this paper, we show how to extend Anne Bergron's algorithm for SBT to include deletions, which allows us to compare genomes containing different genes. We present an asymptotically optimal algorithm for transforming $\Pi$ to $\Gamma$ by translocations and deletions, providing a feasible sequence with length at most OP T +2, where OP T is the minimum number of translocations and deletions transforming $\Pi$ to $\Gamma$. Furthermore, this analysis can be used to approximate the minimum number of translocations and insertions transforming one genome to another.},

Using multi-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and adjustment of p-values to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR{\textless}10{\%}), we identified a signature of 2959 genes differentiating DSS patients from both DF and DHF, and showed a strong association of this DSS-gene signature with the dengue disease phenotype. Using a combined approach to analyse the molecular patterns associated with the DSS-gene signature, we provide an integrative overview of the transcriptional responses altered in DSS children. In particular, we show that the transcriptome of DSS children blood cells is characterized by a decreased abundance of transcripts related to T and NK lymphocyte responses and by an increased abundance of anti-inflammatory and repair/remodeling transcripts. We also show that unexpected pro-inflammatory gene patterns at the interface between innate immunity, inflammation and host lipid metabolism, known to play pathogenic roles in acute and chronic inflammatory diseases associated with systemic vascular dysfunction, are transcriptionnally active in the blood cells of DSS children.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We provide a global while non exhaustive overview of the molecular mechanisms altered in of DSS children and suggest how they may interact to lead to final vascular homeostasis breakdown.

abstract = {The ability to analyze multiple single-cell parameters is critical for understanding cellular heterogeneity. Despite recent advances in measurement technology, methods for analyzing high-dimensional single-cell data are often subjective, labor intensive and require prior knowledge of the biological system. To objectively uncover cellular heterogeneity from single-cell measurements, we present a versatile computational approach, spanning-tree progression analysis of density-normalized events (SPADE). We applied SPADE to flow cytometry data of mouse bone marrow and to mass cytometry data of human bone marrow. In both cases, SPADE organized cells in a hierarchy of related phenotypes that partially recapitulated well-described patterns of hematopoiesis. We demonstrate that SPADE is robust to measurement noise and to the choice of cellular markers. SPADE facilitates the analysis of cellular heterogeneity, the identification of cell types and comparison of functional markers in response to perturbations.},

abstract = {Using expression profiles from postmortem prefrontal cortex samples of 624 dementia patients and non-demented controls, we investigated global disruptions in the co-regulation of genes in two neurodegenerative diseases, late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Huntington's disease (HD). We identified networks of differentially co-expressed (DC) gene pairs that either gained or lost correlation in disease cases relative to the control group, with the former dominant for both AD and HD and both patterns replicating in independent human cohorts of AD and aging. When aligning networks of DC patterns and physical interactions, we identified a 242-gene subnetwork enriched for independent AD/HD signatures. This subnetwork revealed a surprising dichotomy of gained/lost correlations among two inter-connected processes, chromatin organization and neural differentiation, and included DNA methyltransferases, DNMT1 and DNMT3A, of which we predicted the former but not latter as a key regulator. To validate the inter-connection of these two processes and our key regulator prediction, we generated two brain-specific knockout (KO) mice and show that Dnmt1 KO signature significantly overlaps with the subnetwork (P = 3.1 × 10(-12)), while Dnmt3a KO signature does not (P = 0.017).},

@article{Frazee2011,
abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: We evaluate the frequency of emergency department (ED) ultrasonographic probe contamination and the bacterial species involved and evaluate probe cleaning and disinfection methods.

METHODS: This was a 3-part observational cross-sectional study. Surveillance cultures were taken of linear and curvilinear probes on 3 ultrasonographic machines between patient encounters. Cultures of uncovered probes were taken immediately after scanning of skin and soft tissue infections. After experimental probe contamination with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), we assessed 3-step disinfection by sequential cleaning with a dry towel, saline solution-moistened towel, and quaternary ammonia germicidal wipe and 1-step disinfection by germicidal wipe alone. Cultures were obtained by applying the probe to a blood agar plate.

RESULTS: In part 1, of 164 surveillance cultures obtained from 6 probes on 29 sampling days during 11 months, 111 (67{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 60{\%} to 74{\%}) grew normal skin flora or environmental flora, 52 had no growth (32{\%}; 95{\%} CI 25{\%} to 39{\%}), and 2 (1.2{\%}; 95{\%} CI 0.3{\%} to 4.3{\%}) grew a clinically important pathogen. In part 2, 14 of 20 (70{\%}; 95{\%} CI 48{\%} to 85{\%}) cultures taken after skin and soft tissue infection scanning produced heavy growth of a clinically important pathogen, including 13 S aureus (5 MRSA). In part 3, cleaning with a dry and moist towel reduced but did not eliminate MRSA. The germicidal wipe step resulted in no growth in 15 of 15 (100{\%}; 95{\%} CI 80{\%} to 100{\%}) cultures in 3-step disinfection and in 9 of 10 (90{\%}; 95{\%} CI 60{\%} to 98{\%}) when used alone.

CONCLUSION: Skin and environmental flora are commonly present on ultrasonographic probes between patient encounters in our ED; however, clinically important pathogens are uncommon. S aureus (including MRSA) frequently contaminates uncovered probes during skin and soft tissue infection scanning, but in an experimental model, MRSA appears to be reliably removed by a quaternary ammonia germicidal wipe if the probe is partially cleaned first.},

abstract = {A basic task in the analysis of count data from RNA-seq is the detection of differ- entially expressed genes. The count data are presented as a table which reports, for each sample, the number of sequence fragments that have been assigned to each gene. Analogous data also arise for other assay types, including comparative ChIP- Seq, HiC, shRNA screening, mass spectrometry. An important analysis question is the quantification and statistical inference of systematic changes between condi- tions, as compared to within-condition variability. The package DESeq2 provides methods to test for differential expression by use of negative binomial generalized linear models; the estimates of dispersion and logarithmic fold changes incorpo- rate data-driven prior distributions1. This vignette explains the use of the package and demonstrates typical workflows. An RNA-seq workflow2 on the Bioconductor website covers similar material to this vignette but at a slower pace, including the generation of count matrices from FASTQ files},

abstract = {A single mutation can alter cellular and global homeostatic mechanisms and give rise to multiple clinical diseases. We hypothesized that these disease mechanisms could be identified using low minor allele frequency (MAF{\textless}0.1) non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) associated with "mechanistic phenotypes", comprised of collections of related diagnoses. We studied two mechanistic phenotypes: (1) thrombosis, evaluated in a population of 1,655 African Americans; and (2) four groupings of cancer diagnoses, evaluated in 3,009 white European Americans. We tested associations between nsSNPs represented on GWAS platforms and mechanistic phenotypes ascertained from electronic medical records (EMRs), and sought enrichment in functional ontologies across the top-ranked associations. We used a two-step analytic approach whereby nsSNPs were first sorted by the strength of their association with a phenotype. We tested associations using two reverse genetic models and standard additive and recessive models. In the second step, we employed a hypothesis-free ontological enrichment analysis using the sorted nsSNPs to identify functional mechanisms underlying the diagnoses comprising the mechanistic phenotypes. The thrombosis phenotype was solely associated with ontologies related to blood coagulation (Fisher's p = 0.0001, FDR p = 0.03), driven by the F5, P2RY12 and F2RL2 genes. For the cancer phenotypes, the reverse genetics models were enriched in DNA repair functions (p = 2×10-5, FDR p = 0.03) (POLG/FANCI, SLX4/FANCP, XRCC1, BRCA1, FANCA, CHD1L) while the additive model showed enrichment related to chromatid segregation (p = 4×10-6, FDR p = 0.005) (KIF25, PINX1). We were able to replicate nsSNP associations for POLG/FANCI, BRCA1, FANCA and CHD1L in independent data sets. Mechanism-oriented phenotyping using collections of EMR-derived diagnoses can elucidate fundamental disease mechanisms.},

HISAT uses an indexing scheme based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index, employing two types of indexes for alignment: a whole-genome FM index to anchor each alignment and numerous local FM indexes for very rapid extensions of these alignments. HISAT's hierarchical index for the human genome contains 48,000 local FM indexes, each representing a genomic region of ∼64,000 bp. Tests on real and simulated data sets showed that HISAT is the fastest system currently available, with equal or better accuracy than any other method. Despite its large number of indexes, HISAT requires only 4.3 gigabytes of memory. HISAT supports genomes of any size, including those larger than 4 billion bases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a nosocomial opportunistic pathogen of the Xanthomonadaceae. The organism has been isolated from both clinical and soil environments in addition to the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients and the immunocompromised. Whilst relatively distant phylogenetically, the closest sequenced relatives of S. maltophilia are the plant pathogenic xanthomonads. RESULTS: The genome of the bacteremia-associated isolate S. maltophilia K279a is 4,851,126 bp and of high G+C content. The sequence reveals an organism with a remarkable capacity for drug and heavy metal resistance. In addition to a number of genes conferring resistance to antimicrobial drugs of different classes via alternative mechanisms, nine resistance-nodulation-division (RND)-type putative antimicrobial efflux systems are present. Functional genomic analysis confirms a role in drug resistance for several of the novel RND efflux pumps. S. maltophilia possesses potentially mobile regions of DNA and encodes a number of pili and fimbriae likely to be involved in adhesion and biofilm formation that may also contribute to increased antimicrobial drug resistance. CONCLUSION: The panoply of antimicrobial drug resistance genes and mobile genetic elements found suggests that the organism can act as a reservoir of antimicrobial drug resistance determinants in a clinical environment, which is an issue of considerable concern.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of interhospital patient sharing via transfers on the rate of Clostridium difficile infections in a hospital. DESIGN Retrospective cohort. METHODS Using data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project California State Inpatient Database, 2005-2011, we identified 2,752,639 transfers. We then constructed a series of networks detailing the connections formed by hospitals. We computed 2 measures of connectivity, indegree and weighted indegree, measuring the number of hospitals from which transfers into a hospital arrive, and the total number of incoming transfers, respectively. Next, we estimated a multivariate model of C. difficile infection cases using the log-transformed network measures as well as covariates for hospital fixed effects, log median length of stay, log fraction of patients aged 65 or older, and quarter and year indicators as predictors. RESULTS We found an increase of 1 in the log indegree was associated with a 4.8{\%} increase in incidence of C. difficile infection (95{\%} CI, 2.3{\%}-7.4{\%}) and an increase of 1 in log weighted indegree was associated with a 3.3{\%} increase in C. difficile infection incidence (1.5{\%}-5.2{\%}). Moreover, including measures of connectivity in our models greatly improved their fit. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest infection control is not under the exclusive control of a given hospital but is also influenced by the connections and number of connections that hospitals have with other hospitals.},

abstract = {Background: The cost of genomic information has fallen steeply, but the clinical translation of genetic risk estimates remains unclear. We aimed to undertake an integrated analysis of a complete human genome in a clinical context. Methods: We assessed a patient with a family history of vascular disease and early sudden death. Clinical assessment included analysis of this patient's full genome sequence, risk prediction for coronary artery disease, screening for causes of sudden cardiac death, and genetic counselling. Genetic analysis included the development of novel methods for the integration of whole genome and clinical risk. Disease and risk analysis focused on prediction of genetic risk of variants associated with mendelian disease, recognised drug responses, and pathogenicity for novel variants. We queried disease-specific mutation databases and pharmacogenomics databases to identify genes and mutations with known associations with disease and drug response. We estimated post-test probabilities of disease by applying likelihood ratios derived from integration of multiple common variants to age-appropriate and sex-appropriate pre-test probabilities. We also accounted for gene-environment interactions and conditionally dependent risks. Findings: Analysis of 2{\textperiodcentered}6 million single nucleotide polymorphisms and 752 copy number variations showed increased genetic risk for myocardial infarction, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. We discovered rare variants in three genes that are clinically associated with sudden cardiac death-TMEM43, DSP, and MYBPC3. A variant in LPA was consistent with a family history of coronary artery disease. The patient had a heterozygous null mutation in CYP2C19 suggesting probable clopidogrel resistance, several variants associated with a positive response to lipid-lowering therapy, and variants in CYP4F2 and VKORC1 that suggest he might have a low initial dosing requirement for warfarin. Many variants of uncertain importance were reported. Interpretation: Although challenges remain, our results suggest that whole-genome sequencing can yield useful and clinically relevant information for individual patients.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The emergence of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) that can persist in the community and replace existing hospital-adapted lineages of MRSA means that it is necessary to understand transmission dynamics in terms of hospitals and the community as one entity. We assessed the use of whole-genome sequencing to enhance detection of MRSA transmission between these settings. METHODS:We studied a putative MRSA outbreak on a special care baby unit (SCBU) at a National Health Service Foundation Trust in Cambridge, UK. We used whole-genome sequencing to validate and expand findings from an infection-control team who assessed the outbreak through conventional analysis of epidemiological data and antibiogram profiles. We sequenced isolates from all colonised patients in the SCBU, and sequenced MRSA isolates from patients in the hospital or community with the same antibiotic susceptibility profile as the outbreak strain. FINDINGS:The hospital infection-control team identified 12 infants colonised with MRSA in a 6 month period in 2011, who were suspected of being linked, but a persistent outbreak could not be confirmed with conventional methods. With whole-genome sequencing, we identified 26 related cases of MRSA carriage, and showed transmission occurred within the SCBU, between mothers on a postnatal ward, and in the community. The outbreak MRSA type was a new sequence type (ST) 2371, which is closely related to ST22, but contains genes encoding Panton-Valentine leucocidin. Whole-genome sequencing data were used to propose and confirm that MRSA carriage by a staff member had allowed the outbreak to persist during periods without known infection on the SCBU and after a deep clean. INTERPRETATION:Whole-genome sequencing holds great promise for rapid, accurate, and comprehensive identification of bacterial transmission pathways in hospital and community settings, with concomitant reductions in infections, morbidity, and costs.

abstract = {Candidate HIV-1 vaccines currently being evaluated in clinical trials are designed to elicit HIV-1-specific cellular immunity. Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assays allow sensitive, quantitative ex vivo assessments of antigen-specific T cells including immunophenotyping of responding cells and measurement of multiple effector functions. Additionally, the use of banked cryopreserved PBMC samples makes this assay attractive in the setting of large efficacy trials where it is less feasible to perform immunoassays on freshly isolated samples. Here we describe extensive studies to optimize and quantitatively validate the 8-color ICS assay for use in clinical trials of candidate vaccines, which includes measurement of viable IFN-??, IL-2, TNF-?? and IL-4 producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We show that omission of viability dye staining results in an over-estimate of the true antigen-specific T cell response by up to two-fold. After optimization, the 8-color assay was validated for specificity, precision, linearity, limit of quantitation and robustness. The assay has a lower quantitation limit generally below 0.04{\%}, depending on the cytokine subset. Additionally, with appropriate gating, the 8-color assay gives comparable cytokine-positive responses to those observed with the conventional 4-color assay. In conclusion, we provide the first description of a quantitatively validated ICS assay, which permits quantitative and qualitative evaluation of vaccine-induced immunogenicity and analysis of immune correlates of protection. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Innovations in sequencing technologies have allowed biologists to make incredible advances in understanding biological systems. As experience grows, researchers increasingly recognize that analyzing the wealth of data provided by these new sequencing platforms requires careful attention to detail for robust results. Thus far, much of the scientific Communit's focus for use in bacterial genomics has been on evaluating genome assembly algorithms and rigorously validating assembly program performance. Missing, however, is a focus on critical evaluation of variant callers for these genomes. Variant calling is essential for comparative genomics as it yields insights into nucleotide-level organismal differences. Variant calling is a multistep process with a host of potential error sources that may lead to incorrect variant calls. Identifying and resolving these incorrect calls is critical for bacterial genomics to advance. The goal of this review is to provide guidance on validating algorithms and pipelines used in variant calling for bacterial genomics. First, we will provide an overview of the variant calling procedures and the potential sources of error associated with the methods. We will then identify appropriate datasets for use in evaluating algorithms and describe statistical methods for evaluating algorithm performance. As variant calling moves from basic research to the applied setting, standardized methods for performance evaluation and reporting are required; it is our hope that this review provides the groundwork for the development of these standards.},

abstract = {We present a new open source, extensible and flexible software platform for Bayesian evolutionary analysis called BEAST 2. This software platform is a re-design of the popular BEAST 1 platform to correct structural deficiencies that became evident as the BEAST 1 software evolved. Key among those deficiencies was the lack of post-deployment extensibility. BEAST 2 now has a fully developed package management system that allows third party developers to write additional functionality that can be directly installed to the BEAST 2 analysis platform via a package manager without requiring a new software release of the platform. This package architecture is showcased with a number of recently published new models encompassing birth-death-sampling tree priors, phylodynamics and model averaging for substitution models and site partitioning. A second major improvement is the ability to read/write the entire state of the MCMC chain to/from disk allowing it to be easily shared between multiple instances of the BEAST software. This facilitates checkpointing and better support for multi-processor and high-end computing extensions. Finally, the functionality in new packages can be easily added to the user interface (BEAUti 2) by a simple XML template-based mechanism because BEAST 2 has been re-designed to provide greater integration between the analysis engine and the user interface so that, for example BEAST and BEAUti use exactly the same XML file format.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and is endemic in hospitals, hindering the identification of sources and routes of transmission based on shared time and space alone. This may compromise rational control despite costly prevention strategies. This study aimed to investigate ward-based transmission of C. difficile, by subdividing outbreaks into distinct lineages defined by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: All C. difficile toxin enzyme-immunoassay-positive and culture-positive samples over 2.5 y from a geographically defined population of {\~{}}600,000 persons underwent MLST. Sequence types (STs) were combined with admission and ward movement data from an integrated comprehensive healthcare system incorporating three hospitals (1,700 beds) providing all acute care for the defined geographical population. Networks of cases and potential transmission events were constructed for each ST. Potential infection sources for each case and transmission timescales were defined by prior ward-based contact with other cases sharing the same ST. From 1 September 2007 to 31 March 2010, there were means of 102 tests and 9.4 CDIs per 10,000 overnight stays in inpatients, and 238 tests and 15.7 CDIs per month in outpatients/primary care. In total, 1,276 C. difficile isolates of 69 STs were studied. From MLST, no more than 25{\%} of cases could be linked to a potential ward-based inpatient source, ranging from 37{\%} in renal/transplant, 29{\%} in haematology/oncology, and 28{\%} in acute/elderly medicine to 6{\%} in specialist surgery. Most of the putative transmissions identified occurred shortly (≤ 1 wk) after the onset of symptoms (141/218, 65{\%}), with few {\textgreater}8 wk (21/218, 10{\%}). Most incubation periods were ≤ 4 wk (132/218, 61{\%}), with few {\textgreater}12 wk (28/218, 13{\%}). Allowing for persistent ward contamination following ward discharge of a CDI case did not increase the proportion of linked cases after allowing for random meeting of matched controls.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In an endemic setting with well-implemented infection control measures, ward-based contact with symptomatic enzyme-immunoassay-positive patients cannot account for most new CDI cases.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:To identify and appraise empirical studies on publication and related biases published since 1998; to assess methods to deal with publication and related biases; and to examine, in a random sample of published systematic reviews, measures taken to prevent, reduce and detect dissemination bias.

DATA SOURCES:The main literature search, in August 2008, covered the Cochrane Methodology Register Database, MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED and CINAHL. In May 2009, PubMed, PsycINFO and OpenSIGLE were also searched. Reference lists of retrieved studies were also examined.

REVIEW METHODS:In Part I, studies were classified as evidence or method studies and data were extracted according to types of dissemination bias or methods for dealing with it. Evidence from empirical studies was summarised narratively. In Part II, 300 systematic reviews were randomly selected from MEDLINE and the methods used to deal with publication and related biases were assessed.

RESULTS:Studies with significant or positive results were more likely to be published than those with non-significant or negative results, thereby confirming findings from a previous HTA report. There was convincing evidence that outcome reporting bias exists and has an impact on the pooled summary in systematic reviews. Studies with significant results tended to be published earlier than studies with non-significant results, and empirical evidence suggests that published studies tended to report a greater treatment effect than those from the grey literature. Exclusion of non-English-language studies appeared to result in a high risk of bias in some areas of research such as complementary and alternative medicine. In a few cases, publication and related biases had a potentially detrimental impact on patients or resource use. Publication bias can be prevented before a literature review (e.g. by prospective registration of trials), or detected during a literature review (e.g. by locating unpublished studies, funnel plot and related tests, sensitivity analysis modelling), or its impact can be minimised after a literature review (e.g. by confirmatory large-scale trials, updating the systematic review). The interpretation of funnel plot and related statistical tests, often used to assess publication bias, was often too simplistic and likely misleading. More sophisticated modelling methods have not been widely used. Compared with systematic reviews published in 1996, recent reviews of health-care interventions were more likely to locate and include non-English-language studies and grey literature or unpublished studies, and to test for publication bias.

CONCLUSIONS:Dissemination of research findings is likely to be a biased process, although the actual impact of such bias depends on specific circumstances. The prospective registration of clinical trials and the endorsement of reporting guidelines may reduce research dissemination bias in clinical research. In systematic reviews, measures can be taken to minimise the impact of dissemination bias by systematically searching for and including relevant studies that are difficult to access. Statistical methods can be useful for sensitivity analyses. Further research is needed to develop methods for qualitatively assessing the risk of publication bias in systematic reviews, and to evaluate the effect of prospective registration of studies, open access policy and improved publication guidelines.},

Stool cultures were obtained from 634 (94{\%}) of 678 consecutive admissions to the ward (ward admissions), and all C. difficile isolates were typed by restriction endonuclease analysis. Sixty-five ward admissions introduced C. difficile to the ward, and 54 initially culture-negative admissions acquired C. difficile on the ward. Ward admissions hospitalized within the prior 30 days in the medical center were more likely to be culture-positive for C. difficile at admission to the study ward than those not previously hospitalized at the institution (16{\%} vs. 7{\%}, P less than .001). Nosocomial acquisition of a C. difficile strain was preceded by a documented introduction of that strain to the ward by another asymptomatic ward admission in 16 (84{\%}) of 19 instances, suggesting that C. difficile-colonized new admissions are a major source of nosocomial C. difficile infections.},

The increasing number of clinical record entries that have become available electronically provides access to rich, large sets of patients' longitudinal medical information. By integrating and comparing relations found in the EHRs with those already reported in the literature, we are able to verify existing and to identify rare or novel associations. Of particular interest is the identification of rare disease co-morbidities, where the small numbers of diagnosed patients make robust statistical analysis difficult. Here, we introduce ADAMS, an Application for Discovering Disease Associations using Multiple Sources, which contains various statistical and language processing operations. We apply ADAMS to the New York-Presbyterian Hospital's EHR to combine the information from the relational diagnosis tables and textual discharge summaries with those from PubMed and Wikipedia in order to investigate the co-morbidities of the rare diseases Kaposi sarcoma, toxoplasmosis, and Kawasaki disease. In addition to finding well-known characteristics of diseases, ADAMS can identify rare or previously unreported associations. In particular, we report a statistically significant association between Kawasaki disease and diagnosis of autistic disorder.},

DEN prM was detected primarily in activated monocytes (CD14(+), CD32(+), CD86(+), CD11c(+)). A subset of samples analyzed for DEN nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) confirmed that approximately half of DEN antigen-positive cells contained replicating virus. A higher percentage of PBMCs from DHF patients expressed prM, CD86, CD32, and CD11c than did those from DF patients.

abstract = {Variable tandem repeats are frequently used for genetic mapping, genotyping, and forensics studies. Moreover, variation in some repeats underlies rapidly evolving traits or certain diseases. However, mutation rates vary greatly from repeat to repeat, and as a consequence, not all tandem repeats are suitable genetic markers or interesting unstable genetic modules. We developed a model, "SERV," that predicts the variability of a broad range of tandem repeats in a wide range of organisms. The nonlinear model uses three basic characteristics of the repeat (number of repeated units, unit length, and purity) to produce a numeric "VARscore" that correlates with repeat variability. SERV was experimentally validated using a large set of different artificial repeats located in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae URA3 gene. Further in silico analysis shows that SERV outperforms existing models and accurately predicts repeat variability in bacteria and eukaryotes, including plants and humans. Using SERV, we demonstrate significant enrichment of variable repeats within human genes involved in transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling, morphogenesis, and neurogenesis. Moreover, SERV allows identification of known and candidate genes involved in repeat-based diseases. In addition, we demonstrate the use of SERV for the selection and comparison of suitable variable repeats for genotyping and forensic purposes. Our analysis indicates that tandem repeats used for genotyping should have a VARscore between 1 and 3. SERV is publicly available from http://hulsweb1.cgr.harvard.edu/SERV/.},

Transcripts relating to the adaptive immune response were over-expressed in the second sampling point with sustained activation at the third sampling. On an individual gene level, significant enrichment of transcripts early in dengue disease were chemokines CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL8 (MCP-2), CXCL10 (IP-10) and CCL3 (MIP-1$\alpha$), antimicrobial peptide $\beta$-defensin 1 (DEFB1), desmosome/intermediate junction component plakoglobin (JUP) and a microRNA which may negatively regulate pro-inflammatory cytokines in dengue infected peripheral blood cells, mIR-147 (NMES1).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These data show that the early response in patients mimics those previously described in vitro, where early assessment of transcriptional responses has been easily obtained. Several of the early transcripts identified may be affected by or mediate the pathogenesis and deserve further assessment at this timepoint in correlation to severe disease.},

abstract = {To analyse whether the mutation-driven resistance-acquisition potential of a given bacterium might be a function of its intrinsic resistome, quinolones were used as selective agents and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was chosen as a bacterial model. S. maltophilia has two elements - SmQnr and SmeDEF - that are important in intrinsic resistance to quinolones. Using a battery of mutants in which either or both of these elements had been removed, the apparent mutation frequency for quinolone resistance and the phenotype of the selected mutants were found to be related to the intrinsic resistome and also depended on the concentration of the selector. Most mutants had phenotypes compatible with the overexpression of multidrug efflux pump(s); SmeDEF overexpression was the most common cause of quinolone resistance. Whole genome sequencing showed that mutations of the SmeRv regulator, which result in the overexpression of the efflux pump SmeVWX, are the cause of quinolone resistance in mutants not overexpressing SmeDEF. These results indicate that the development of mutation-driven antibiotic resistance is highly dependent on the intrinsic resistome, which, at least for synthetic antibiotics such as quinolones, did not develop as a response to the presence of antibiotics in the natural ecosystems in which S. maltophilia evolved.},

abstract = {Based on CD14 and CD16 expression, human peripheral blood monocytes (MO) can be divided into a major CD14(high) CD16(-) population and two minor CD14(high) CD16(+) and CD14(dim) CD16(+) subpopulations. CD14(dim) CD16(+) MO are well characterized and regarded as pro-inflammatory because upon stimulation produce TNF-alpha but little, if any, IL-10. By contrast, little is known about CD14(high) CD16(+) MO. We investigated the surface expression of selected determinants by CD16(+) MO subpopulations, cytokine production, phagocytosis and antigen presentation. We found that both CD16(+) subpopulations had a higher expression of HLA-DR, CD86, CD54 and a lower expression of CD64 than CD14(high) CD16(-) population. In addition, CD14(high) CD16(+) MO showed a higher expression of CD11b and TLR4 than CD14(dim) CD16(+) and CD14(high) CD16(-) subpopulations. CD14(high) CD16(+) MO exhibited an increased phagocytic activity and a decreased antigen presentation in comparison with CD14(dim) CD16(+). As expected, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated CD14(dim) CD16(+) MO produced TNF-alpha but little IL-10. By contrast, LPS-stimulated CD14(high) CD16(+) subpopulation produced significantly more IL-10 than CD14(dim) CD16(+) and CD14(high) CD16(-) MO. In conclusion, our data show that human peripheral blood CD16(+) MO are heterogeneous in function and consist of two subpopulations: CD14(dim) CD16(+) pro-inflammatory and CD14(high) CD16(+) with anti-inflammatory potential.},

abstract = {Since its discovery, Chikungunya fever caused by a virus (CHIKV) has ravaged most of Africa and Southeast Asia. Despite there being more than a million reported cases in India alone and the seriousness of the disease in the chronic phase, a clear understanding of the disease pathogenesis and host response remains elusive. Here, we use microarray technology and quantitative PCR method to establish the complete miRNA, snoRNA and mRNA signature of host response upon CHIKV infection in human cell line infection model, HEK293T. The results were further validated in human primary cells (dermal fibroblasts). miRNA expression profiling revealed regulation of 152 miRNAs post CHIKV infection. An interesting overlap in miRNA signature was seen majorly with HCV, HPV and HIV1 virus. The microarray data further validated by qRT-PCR revealed induction of miR-744, miR-638, miR-503 and others among the top upregulated miRNAs. Notably, we found induction of snoRNAs belonging to C/D cluster including close paralogs of U3, U44, U76 and U78 snoRNAs. Genes were found to be differentially expressed along 3 major pathways; TGF-$\beta$, endocytosis and the cell cycle pathways. qRT-PCR data confirmed strong induction of TGF-$\beta$ (SMAD6, JUN, SKIL) and endocytosis pathway (CXCR4, HSPA8, ADRB1) genes while downregulation of cell cycle genes (CDC27 and CDC23). Interestingly, use of TGF-$\beta$ inhibitor, SB-431542, increased CHIKV mediated cell death. Overall, this study aims at providing the first complete transcriptome signature of host response upon CHIKV infection to aid identification of possible biomarkers and therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {Bacterial super-infections are the main cause of complication and mortality after influenza virus (IAV) infection. Since Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is considered non-pathogenic for humans and is widely sprayed in urban areas, the aim of this work was to evaluate the potential pathogenicity of a combined infection Bt-IAV in a mouse model of pneumonia. Bacteria used for super-infections were Bt serotype H34 isolated from human infection and the insecticidal strain 3a3b obtained from a commercial source. Virus strain was A/Scotland/20/74 (H3N2) adapted to BALB/c mice by serial lung passage. Combined infection with 4{\%} of the viral lethal dose 50{\%} (LD(50)) and 10(2) spores of Bt H34 killed 40{\%} of the mice. Mortality rates increased up to 55{\%} and 100{\%} when combined infections were done with respectively 10(4) and 10(7) spores. The insecticidal strain Bt 3a3b was less pathogenic than Bt H34. A dose of 10(4) spores associated with 4{\%} of IAV LD(50) killed 50{\%} of the mice. This inoculum must be compared with the doses usually sprayed in agriculture: 10(11) spores m(-2). Total protection against super-infection was obtained when mice were treated with amantadine. Even if only a few cases of Bt human infection have been reported, these results suggest a possible risk for workers spraying Bt-based biopesticides during flu outbreaks.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To ascertain the participation of topoisomerase mutations in the development of ciprofloxacin resistance in isogenic Stenotrophomonas maltophilia mutants. METHODS: gyrAB and parCE sequences in three paired in vivo isogenic ciprofloxacin-susceptible (MIC range 0.5-4 mg/L) and resistant (16-128 mg/L) S. maltophilia strains (PFGE-characterized) sequentially isolated from three patients, and their corresponding in vitro mutants (ciprofloxacin MIC range 2-{\textgreater}128 mg/L), were studied. Efflux phenotype was also investigated. RESULTS: Despite different quinolone susceptibilities, each paired clinical strain displayed identical gyrAB and parCE sequences as well as their corresponding in vitro mutants. Up to 50{\%} (18/36) of in vitro mutants displayed a positive efflux phenotype when nalidixic acid was combined with MC-207,110, while 6{\%} (2/36) showed the phenotype when exposed to nalidixic acid and reserpine. Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone or arsenite failed to alter quinolone MICs. CONCLUSIONS: The increase of ciprofloxacin MICs in in vivo and in vitro isogenic S. maltophilia mutant strains was not related to quinolone resistance determining region mutations. Highly effective efflux mechanisms might preserve topoisomerase targets from a ciprofloxacin challenge in S. maltophilia.},

abstract = {A restrictive antibiotic policy banning routine use of ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin was implemented in a 450-bed district general hospital following an educational campaign. Monthly consumption of nine antibiotics was monitored in defined daily doses (DDDs) per 1000 patient-occupied bed-days (1000 pt-bds) 9 months before until 16 months after policy introduction. Hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and extended-spectrum ??-lactamase (ESBL)-producing coliform cases per month/1000 pt-bds were identified and reviewed throughout the hospital. Between the first and final 6 months of the study, average monthly consumption of ceftriaxone reduced by 95{\%} (from 46.213 to 2.129 DDDs/1000 pt-bds) and that for ciprofloxacin by 72.5{\%} (109.804 to 30.205 DDDs/1000 pt-bds). Over the same periods, hospital-acquisition rates for C. difficile reduced by 77{\%} (2.398 to 0.549 cases/1000 pt-bds), for MRSA by 25{\%} (1.187 to 0.894 cases/1000 pt-bds) and for ESBL-producing coliforms by 17{\%} (1.480 to 1.224 cases/1000 pt-bds). Time-lag modelling confirmed significant associations between ceftriaxone and C. difficile cases at 1 month (correlation 0.83; P {\textless} 0.005), and between ciprofloxacin and ESBL-producing coliform cases at 2 months (correlation 0.649; P = 0.002). An audit performed 3 years after the policy showed sustained reduction in C. difficile rates (0.259 cases/1000 pt-bds), with additional decreases for MRSA (0.409 cases/1000 pt-bds) and ESBL-producing coliforms (0.809 cases/1000 pt-bds). In conclusion, banning two antibiotics resulted in an immediate and profound reduction in hospital-acquired C. difficile, with possible longer-term effects on MRSA and ESBL-producing coliform rates. Antibiotic stewardship is fundamental in the control of major hospital pathogens. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. and the International Society of Chemotherapy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Burkholderia cepacia complex is associated with colonization or disease in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). For patients without CF, this complex is poorly understood apart from its presence in occasional point source outbreaks.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate risk factors for B. cepacia bacteremia in hospitalized, intensive care unit patients without CF.

METHODS: We identified patients with 1 or more blood cultures positive for B. cepacia between May 1, 1996, and March 31, 2002, excluding those with CF. Control patients were matched to case patients by ward, duration of hospitalization, and onset date of bacteremia. Matched analyses were used to identify risk factors for B. cepacia bacteremia.

RESULTS: We enrolled 40 patients with B. cepacia bacteremia into the study. No environmental or other point source for B. cepacia complex was identified, although horizontal spread was suspected. Implementation of contact precautions was effective in decreasing the incidence of B. cepacia bacteremia. We selected 119 matched controls. Age, sex, and race were similar between cases and controls. In multivariable analysis, renal failure that required dialysis, recent abdominal surgery, 2 or more bronchoscopic procedures before detection of B. cepacia bacteremia, tracheostomy, and presence of a central line before detection of B. cepacia bacteremia were independently associated with development of B. cepacia bacteremia, whereas presence of a percutaneous feeding tube was associated with a lower risk of disease.

CONCLUSIONS: B. cepacia complex is an important emerging group of nosocomial pathogens in patients with and patients without CF. Nosocomial spread is likely facilitated by cross-transmission, frequent pulmonary procedures, and central venous access. Infection control measures appear useful for limiting the spread of virulent, transmissible clones of B. cepacia complex.},

We introduce StringTie, a computational method that applies a network flow algorithm originally developed in optimization theory, together with optional de novo assembly, to assemble these complex data sets into transcripts. When used to analyze both simulated and real data sets, StringTie produces more complete and accurate reconstructions of genes and better estimates of expression levels, compared with other leading transcript assembly programs including Cufflinks, IsoLasso, Scripture and Traph. For example, on 90 million reads from human blood, StringTie correctly assembled 10,990 transcripts, whereas the next best assembly was of 7,187 transcripts by Cufflinks, which is a 53{\%} increase in transcripts assembled. On a simulated data set, StringTie correctly assembled 7,559 transcripts, which is 20{\%} more than the 6,310 assembled by Cufflinks. As well as producing a more complete transcriptome assembly, StringTie runs faster on all data sets tested to date compared with other assembly software, including Cufflinks.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and related arboviruses have been responsible for large epidemic outbreaks with serious economic and social impact. Although infected individuals clear the virus from the blood, some develop debilitating and prolonged arthralgia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We investigated specificity and strength of antibody responses in a longitudinal study on CHIKV-infected patients and analyzed their association with viral load, cytokine profile, and severity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We found that CHIKV-specific response is dominated by immunoglobulin G3 (IgG3) antibodies. The antibodies were neutralizing, and patients with high viremia rapidly developed high levels of anti-CHIKV antibodies of this specific isotype. Although these patients endured a more severe disease progression during the acute viremic phase, they cleared the virus faster and did not experience persistent arthralgia. However, significant persistent arthralgia was observed in patients with low viremia who developed IgG3 at a later stage.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Absence of early CHIKV-specific IgG3 may therefore serve as a specific marker of patients with increased risk of disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been a trend in increasing the phylogenetic scope of genome sequencing without finishing the sequence of the genome. Increasing numbers of genomes are being published in scaffold or contig form. Rearrangement algorithms, however, including gene order-based phylogenetic tools, require whole genome data on gene order or syntenic block order. How then can we use rearrangement algorithms to compare genomes available in scaffold form only? Can the comparative evidence predict the location of unsequenced genes? RESULTS: Our method involves optimally filling in genes missing from the scaffolds, while incorporating the augmented scaffolds directly into the rearrangement algorithms as if they were chromosomes. This is accomplished by an exact, polynomial-time algorithm. We then correct for the number of extra fusion/fission operations required to make scaffolds comparable to full assemblies. We model the relationship between the ratio of missing genes actually absent from the genome versus merely unsequenced ones, on one hand, and the increase of genomic distance after scaffold filling, on the other. We estimate the parameters of this model through simulations and by comparing the angiosperm genomes Ricinus communis and Vitis vinifera. CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm solves the comparison of genomes with 18,300 genes, including 4500 missing from one genome, in less than a minute on a MacBook, putting virtually all genomes within range of the method.},

abstract = {Episodes of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) are difficult to treat for several reasons. Foremost, data are lacking to support any particular treatment strategy. In addition, treatment of recurrent episodes is not always successful, and repeated, prolonged treatment is often necessary. Identification of subgroups at risk for recurrent CDI may aid in diagnosing and treating these patients. Two likely mechanistic factors increasing the risk of recurrent CDI are an inadequate immune response to C. difficile toxins and persistent disruption of the normal colonic flora. Important epidemiologic risk factors include advanced age, continuation of other antibiotics, and prolonged hospital stays. Current guidelines recommend that the first recurrent episode be treated with the same agent (i.e., metronidazole or vancomycin) used for the index episode. However, if the first recurrence is characterized as severe, vancomycin should be used. A reasonable strategy for managing a subsequent episode involves tapering followed by pulsed doses of vancomycin. Other potentially effective strategies for recurrent CDI include vancomycin with adjunctive treatments, such as Saccharomyces boulardii, rifaximin "chaser" therapy after vancomycin, nitazoxanide, fecal transplantation, and intravenous immunoglobulin. New treatment agents that are active against C. difficile, but spare critical components of the normal flora, may decrease the incidence of recurrent CDI.},

abstract = {CyTOF enables the study of the immune system with a complexity, depth, and multidimensionality never achieved before. However, the full potential of using CyTOF can be limited by scarce cell samples. Barcoding strategies developed based on direct labeling of cells using maleimido-monoamide-DOTA (m-DOTA) provide a very useful tool. However, using m-DOTA has some inherent problems, mainly associated with signal intensity. This may be a source of uncertainty when samples are multiplexed. As an alternative or complementary approach to m-DOTA, conjugating an antibody, specific for a membrane protein present on most immune cells, with different isotopes could address the issues of stability and signal intensity needed for effective barcoding. We chose for this purpose CD45, and designed experiments to address different types of cultures and the ability to detect extra- and intra-cellular targets. We show here that our approach provides an useful alternative to m-DOTA in terms of sensitivity, specificity, flexibility, and user-friendliness. Our manuscript provides details to effectively barcode immune cells, overcoming limitations in current technology and enabling the use of CyTOF with scarce samples (for instance precious clinical samples). {\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors.

abstract = {ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE THREATS IN THE UNITED STATES, 2013 Executive Summary Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2013 is a snapshot of the complex problem of antibiotic resistance today and the potentially catastrophic consequences of inaction. The overriding purpose of this report is to increase awareness of the threat that antibiotic resistance poses and to encourage immediate action to address the threat. This document can serve as a reference for anyone looking for information about antibiotic resistance. It is specifically designed to be accessible to many audiences. For more technical information, references and links are provided. This report covers bacteria causing severe human infections and the antibiotics used to treat those infections. In addition, Candida, a fungus that commonly causes serious illness, especially among hospital patients, is included because it, too, is showing increasing resistance to the drugs used for treatment. When discussing the pathogens included in this report, Candida will be included when referencing “bacteria” for simplicity. Also, infections caused by the bacteria Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) are also included in this report. Although C. difficile infections are not yet significantly resistant to the drugs used to treat them, most are directly related to antibiotic use and thousands of Americans are affected each year. Drug resistance related to viruses such as HIV and influenza is not included, nor is drug resistance among parasites such as those that cause malaria. These are important problems but are beyond the scope of this report. The report consists of multiple one or two page summaries of cross-cutting and bacteria- specific antibiotic resistance topics. The first section provides context and an overview of antibiotic resistance in the United States. In addition to giving a national assessment of the most dangerous antibiotic resistance threats, it summarizes what is known about the burden of illness, level of concern, and antibiotics left to defend against these infections. This first section also includes some basic background information, such as fact sheets about antibiotic safety and the harmful impact that resistance can have on high-risk groups, including those with chronic illnesses such as cancer. CDC estimates that in the United States, more than two million people are sickened every year with antibiotic-resistant infections, with at least 23,000 dying as a result. The estimates are based on conservative assumptions and are likely minimum estimates. They are the best approximations that can be derived from currently available data. Regarding level of concern, CDC has — for the first time — prioritized bacteria in this report into one of three categories: urgent, serious, and concerning.},

abstract = {Alphaviruses, including Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), produce a transient illness in humans, but severe forms leading to chronic incapacitating arthralgia/arthritis have been reported by mechanisms largely ill-characterized. The pathogenesis of CHIKV was addressed in a prospective cohort study of 49 hospitalized patients from Reunion Island subsequently categorized into two distinct groups at 12 mo postinfection. Comprehensive analyses of the clinical and immunological parameters throughout the disease course were analyzed in either the "recovered" or the "chronic" groups to identify prognostic markers of arthritis-like pathology after CHIKV disease. We found that the chronic group consisted mainly of more elderly patients ({\textgreater}60 y) and with much higher viral loads (up to 10(10) viruses per milliliter of blood) during the acute phase. Remarkably, a rapid innate immune antiviral response was demonstrated by robust dendritic/NK/CD4/CD8 cell activation and accompanied by a rather weak Th1/Th2 cytokine response in both groups. Interestingly, the antiviral immune response witnessed by high levels of IFN-alpha mRNA in PBMCs and circulating IL-12 persisted for months only in the chronic group. CHIKV (RNA and proteins) was found in perivascular synovial macrophages in one chronic patient 18 mo postinfection surrounded by infiltrating NK and T cells (CD4(++) but rare cytotoxic CD8). Fibroblast hyperplasia, strong angiogenesis, tissue lesions given the high levels of matrix metalloproteinase 2, and acute cell death [high cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase staining] were observed in the injured synovial tissue. These observed cellular and molecular events may contribute to chronic arthralgia/arthritis targeted by methotrexate used empirically for effective treatment but with immunosuppressive function in a context of viral persistence.},

abstract = {Targeted resequencing by massively parallel sequencing has become an effective and affordable way to survey small to large portions of the genome for genetic variation. Despite the rapid development in open source software for analysis of such data, the practical implementation of these tools through construction of sequencing analysis pipelines still remains a challenging and laborious activity, and a major hurdle for many small research and clinical laboratories. We developed TREVA (Targeted REsequencing Virtual Appliance), making pre-built pipelines immediately available as a virtual appliance. Based on virtual machine technologies, TREVA is a solution for rapid and efficient deployment of complex bioinformatics pipelines to laboratories of all sizes, enabling reproducible results. The analyses that are supported in TREVA include: somatic and germline single-nucleotide and insertion/deletion variant calling, copy number analysis, and cohort-based analyses such as pathway and significantly mutated genes analyses. TREVA is flexible and easy to use, and can be customised by Linux-based extensions if required. TREVA can also be deployed on the cloud (cloud computing), enabling instant access without investment overheads for additional hardware. TREVA is available at http://bioinformatics.petermac.org/treva/.},

abstract = {Development of daptomycin (DAP) resistance in Enterococcus faecalis has recently been associated with mutations in genes encoding proteins with two main functions: (i) control of the cell envelope stress response to antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides (LiaFSR system) and (ii) cell membrane phospholipid metabolism (glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase and cardiolipin synthase [cls]). However, the genetic bases for DAP resistance in Enterococcus faecium are unclear. We performed whole-genome comparative analysis of a clinical strain pair, DAP-susceptible E. faecium S447 and its DAP-resistant derivative R446, which was recovered from a single patient during DAP therapy. By comparative whole-genome sequencing, DAP resistance in R446 was associated with changes in 8 genes. Two of these genes encoded proteins involved in phospholipid metabolism: (i) an R218Q substitution in Cls and (ii) an A292G reversion in a putative cyclopropane fatty acid synthase enzyme. The DAP-resistant derivative R446 also exhibited an S333L substitution in the putative histidine kinase YycG, a member of the YycFG system, which, similar to LiaFSR, has been involved in cell envelope homeostasis and DAP resistance in other Gram-positive cocci. Additional changes identified in E. faecium R446 (DAP resistant) included two putative proteins involved in transport (one for carbohydrate and one for sulfate) and three enzymes predicted to play a role in general metabolism. Exchange of the "susceptible" cls allele from S447 for the "resistant" one belonging to R446 did not affect DAP susceptibility. Our results suggest that, apart from the LiaFSR system, the essential YycFG system is likely to be an important mediator of DAP resistance in some E. faecium strains.},

abstract = {The neuraminidase (NA) gene of influenza A/WSN/33 (WSN) virus has previously been shown to be associated with neurovirulence in mice and growth in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells. Nucleotide sequence analysis has indicated that the NA of WSN virus lacks a conserved glycosylation site at position 130 (corresponding to position 146 in the N2 subtype). To investigate the role of this carbohydrate in viral pathogenicity, we used reverse genetics methods to generate a Glyc+ mutant virus, in which the glycosylation site Asn-130 was introduced into the WSN virus NA. Unlike the wild-type WSN virus, the Glyc+ mutant virus did not undergo multicycle replication in MDBK cells in the absence of trypsin, presumably because of lack of cleavage activation of infectivity. In contrast, revertant viruses derived from the Glyc+ mutant were able to replicate in MDBK cells without exogenous protease. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the NAs of the revertant viruses had lost the introduced glycosylation site. In contrast to wild-type and revertant viruses, the Glyc+ mutant virus was not able to multiply in mouse brain. These results suggest that the absence of a glycosylation site at position 130 of the NA plays a key role in the neurovirulence of WSN virus in mice.},

abstract = {Blood represents a reservoir and a migration compartment of cells of the immune system. Traditional microbiologic diagnostic tests relied on laboratory identification of the pathogen causing the infection. However, this approach is less than optimal for a variety of reasons: pathogen's slow growth, resistance to cultivation in vitro or insufficient proof to establish causality when a pathogen is identified. An alternative approach to the pathogen-detection strategy is based on a comprehensive analysis of the host response to the infection by analysis of blood leukocytes gene expression profiles. This strategy has been successfully applied to distinguish and classify children and adults with acute infections caused by different pathogens. Molecular distance to health (MDTH) is a genomic score that measures the global transcriptional perturbation in each individual patient compared to healthy controls. Studies indicate that MDTH is a promising biomarker to help classifying patients according to clinical severity.},

abstract = {Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-borne alphavirus, has traditionally circulated in Africa and Asia, causing human febrile illness accompanied by severe, chronic joint pain. In Africa, epidemic emergence of CHIKV involves the transition from an enzootic, sylvatic cycle involving arboreal mosquito vectors and nonhuman primates, into an urban cycle where peridomestic mosquitoes transmit among humans. In Asia, however, CHIKV appears to circulate only in the endemic, urban cycle. Recently, CHIKV emerged into the Indian Ocean and the Indian subcontinent to cause major epidemics. To examine patterns of CHIKV evolution and the origins of these outbreaks, as well as to examine whether evolutionary rates that vary between enzootic and epidemic transmission, we sequenced the genomes of 40 CHIKV strains and performed a phylogenetic analysis representing the most comprehensive study of its kind to date. We inferred that extant CHIKV strains evolved from an ancestor that existed within the last 500 years and that some geographic overlap exists between two main enzootic lineages previously thought to be geographically separated within Africa. We estimated that CHIKV was introduced from Africa into Asia 70 to 90 years ago. The recent Indian Ocean and Indian subcontinent epidemics appear to have emerged independently from the mainland of East Africa. This finding underscores the importance of surveillance to rapidly detect and control African outbreaks before exportation can occur. Significantly higher rates of nucleotide substitution appear to occur during urban than during enzootic transmission. These results suggest fundamental differences in transmission modes and/or dynamics in these two transmission cycles.},

abstract = {The Tet repressor protein (TetR) regulates transcription of a family of tetracycline (tc) resistance determinants in Gram-negative bacteria. The resistance protein TetA, a membrane-spanning H+-[tc.M]+ antiporter, must be sensitively regulated because its expression is harmful in the absence of tc, yet it has to be expressed before the drugs' concentration reaches cytoplasmic levels inhibitory for protein synthesis. Consequently, TetR shows highly specific tetO binding to reduce basal expression and high affinity to tc to ensure sensitive induction. Tc can cross biological membranes by diffusion enabling this inducer to penetrate the majority of cells. These regulatory and pharmacological properties are the basis for application of TetR to selectively control the expression of single genes in lower and higher eukaryotes. TetR can be used for that purpose in some organisms without further modifications. In mammals and in a large variety of other organisms, however, eukaryotic transcriptional activator or repressor domains are fused to TetR to turn it into an efficient regulator. Mechanistic understanding and the ability to engineer and screen for mutants with specific properties allow tailoring of the DNA recognition specificity, the response to inducer tc and the dimerization specificity of TetR-based eukaryotic regulators. This review provides an overview of the TetR properties as they evolved in bacteria, the functional modifications necessary to transform it into a convenient, specific and efficient regulator for use in eukaryotes and how the interplay between structure--function studies in bacteria and specific requirements of particular applications in eukaryotes have made it a versatile and highly adaptable regulatory system.},

Here we propose a novel method for inferring causality that is no longer constrained by the conditional dependency arguments that limit the ability of statistical causal inference methods to resolve causal relationships within sets of graphical models that are Markov equivalent. Our method utilizes Bayesian belief propagation to infer the responses of perturbation events on molecular traits given a hypothesized graph structure. A distance measure between the inferred response distribution and the observed data is defined to assess the 'fitness' of the hypothesized causal relationships. To test our algorithm, we infer causal relationships within equivalence classes of gene networks in which the form of the functional interactions that are possible are assumed to be nonlinear, given synthetic microarray and RNA sequencing data. We also apply our method to infer causality in real metabolic network with v-structure and feedback loop. We show that our method can recapitulate the causal structure and recover the feedback loop only from steady-state data which conventional method cannot.},

Krystal, M. Enami, J. D. Parvin, and P. Palese, Cell 59:1107-1113, 1989). A chimeric influenza virus A/WSN/33 NA containing the influenza B virus cytoplasmic tail rescued influenza A virus infectivity. The transfectant virus had less NA incorporated into virions than A/WSN/33, indicating that the cytoplasmic tail of influenza virus NA plays a role in incorporation of NA into virions. However, these results also suggest that the influenza A virus and influenza B virus cytoplasmic tail sequences share common features that lead to the production of infectious virus. Transfectant virus was obtained with all cytoplasmic tail mutants generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the influenza A virus tail, except for the mutant resulting from substitution of the conserved proline residue, presumably because of its contribution to the secondary structure of the tail. No virus was rescued when the cytoplasmic tail was deleted, indicating that the cytoplasmic tail is essential for production of the virus. The virulence of the transfectant viruses in mice was directly proportional to the amount of NA incorporated. The importance of the NA cytoplasmic tail in virus assembly and virulence has implications for use in developing antiviral strategies.},

abstract = {A robust high-throughput multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme for Clostridium difficile was developed and validated using a diverse collection of 50 reference isolates representing 45 different PCR ribotypes and 102 isolates from recent clinical samples. A total of 49 PCR ribotypes were represented overall. All isolates were typed by MLST and yielded 40 sequence types (STs). A web-accessible database was set up (http://pubmlst.org/cdifficile/) to facilitate the dissemination and comparison of C. difficile MLST genotyping data among laboratories. MLST and PCR ribotyping were similar in discriminatory abilities, having indices of discrimination of 0.90 and 0.92, respectively. Some STs corresponded to a single PCR ribotype (32/40), other STs corresponded to multiple PCR ribotypes (8/40), and, conversely, the PCR ribotype was not always predictive of the ST. The total number of variable nucleotide sites in the concatenated MLST sequences was 103/3,501 (2.9{\%}). Concatenated MLST sequences were used to construct a neighbor-joining tree which identified four phylogenetic groups of STs and one outlier (ST-11; PCR ribotype 078). These groups apparently correlate with clades identified previously by comparative genomics. The MLST scheme was sufficiently robust to allow direct genotyping of C. difficile in total stool DNA extracts without isolate culture. The direct (nonculture) MLST approach may prove useful as a rapid genotyping method, potentially benefiting individual patients and informing hospital infection control.},

abstract = {Accurate determination of resistance is important to ensure appropriate antimicrobial therapy in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections. This study was undertaken to evaluate the susceptibility results obtained by disc diffusion, E-test, Phoenix system, and reference agar dilution method and also to evaluate the in vitro activity of various antimicrobial combinations against multidrug-resistant S. maltophilia. Susceptibilities to several antimicrobial agents were determined by agar dilution, disc diffusion, and E-test according to the US Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Results were also evaluated in the in Phoenix system for available agents. Twelve different antibiotic combinations were tested for synergy by the E-test method. Most synergic combinations were confirmed by microdilution checkerboard assay. Tigecycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and doxycycline were the most effective drugs against S. maltophilia. Poorest agreement was determined by disc diffusion and E-test against ticarcillin/clavulanate and ciprofloxacin ($\kappa$ {\textless} 0.4), by disc diffusion against colistin ($\kappa$ {\textless} 0.4), and by the Phoenix system against piperacillin/tazobactam ($\kappa$ {\textless} 0.4). Based on these data, disc diffusion seems to be unreliable for ticarcillin/clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, and colistin; E-test for ticarcillin/clavulanate and ciprofloxacin; and the Phoenix system for piperacillin/tazobactam for S. maltophilia susceptibility testing. Synergistic activity was detected predominantly with TMP-SMX + ticarcillin/clavulanate and TMP-SMX + ceftazidime. TMP-SMX + ceftazidime synergy was also supported by the checkerboard method. However, TMP-SMX + ticarcillin/clavulanate combination revealed indifferent effect by the checkerboard assay. As ticarcillin/clavulanate and ciprofloxacin E-test results were beyond the acceptable correlation limits, synergy testing performed with these agents was considered as unreliable. Further studies are required to standardize susceptibility testing, especially for colistin, ticarcillin/clavulanate, and ciprofloxacin for S. maltophilia. TMP-SMX-containing drug combinations seemed to be more synergistic on multidrug-resistant S. maltophilia; however, these results merit further evaluation.},

A mouse-adapted strain of influenza A/Shangdong/09/93 (H3N2) virus was serially passaged in the presence of 1 microM compound. After the fourth passage, breakthrough of resistant virus occurred. By the tenth passage, a twice plaque purified isolate was obtained which could replicate in 10 microM inhibitor. The 50{\%} effective concentration (EC(50)) values for RWJ-270201 against wild-type and resistant viruses, determined by using a cytopathic effect inhibition assay, were 0.007 and 23 microM, respectively. Cross-resistance to zanamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate was observed. The hemagglutinin (HA) and NA genes of the virus were sequenced to determine the mutation(s) which conferred drug resistance. No differences were found between the resistant and wild-type viruses in the NA gene. However, a point mutation resulting in a single amino acid change (Lys189Glu) was found in the resistant viral HA. The wild-type and resistant viruses were compared for virulence in BALB/c mice. The resistant virus was approximately tenfold less virulent than the wild-type virus based upon virus challenge dose. Mice infected with a lethal dose of the resistant virus could still be effectively treated with RWJ-270201. Thus, the HA mutation may allow for the spread of the virus in cell culture in the presence of the NA inhibitor, but not in mice.},

abstract = {In a retrospective survey, 487 research projects approved by the Central Oxford Research Ethics Committee between 1984 and 1987, were studied for evidence of publication bias. As of May, 1990, 285 of the studies had been analysed by the investigators, and 52{\%} of these had been published. Studies with statistically significant results were more likely to be published than those finding no difference between the study groups (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.32; 95{\%} confidence interval [Cl] 1.25-4.28). Studies with significant results were also more likely to lead to a greater number of publications and presentations and to be published in journals with a high citation impact factor. An increased likelihood of publication was also associated with a high rating by the investigator of the importance of the study results, and with increasing sample size. The tendency towards publication bias was greater with observational and laboratory-based experimental studies (OR = 3.79; 95{\%} Cl = 1.47-9.76) than with randomised clinical trials (OR = 0.84; 95{\%} Cl = 0.34-2.09). We have confirmed the presence of publication bias in a cohort of clinical research studies. These findings suggest that conclusions based only on a review of published data should be interpreted cautiously, especially for observational studies. Improved strategies are needed to identify the results of unpublished as well as published studies.},

Participants were monitored for dengue-like illness, and acute and convalescent blood samples were collected from suspected dengue cases.

The overall seroprevalence of anti-DENV antibodies was 91{\%}, increasing from 75{\%} at age 4 to 100{\%} at age 16. The incidence of DENV infection was 12{\%} in Year 1 and 6{\%} in Year 2 (P {\textless} 0.001). During Year 1, four laboratory-confirmed dengue cases were detected, with one DENV2 isolate; during Year 2, there were six confirmed dengue cases, with one DENV1 isolate. These and additional circulating serotypes were confirmed by plaque reduction neutralisation test. This study demonstrates surprisingly high transmission of DENV in urban Nicaragua.},

abstract = {The recent widespread emergence of carbapenem resistance inEnterobacteriaceaeis a major public health concern, as carbapenems are a therapy of last resort in this family of common bacterial pathogens. Resistance genes can mobilize via various mechanisms including conjugation and transposition, however the importance of this mobility in short-term evolution, such as within nosocomial outbreaks, is currently unknown. Using a combination of short- and long-read whole genome sequencing of 281blaKPC-positiveEnterobacteriaceaeisolated from a single hospital over five years, we demonstrate rapid dissemination of this carbapenem resistance gene to multiple species, strains, and plasmids. Mobility ofblaKPCoccurs at multiple nested genetic levels, with transmission ofblaKPCstrains between individuals, frequent transfer ofblaKPCplasmids between strains/species, and frequent transposition of theblaKPCtransposon Tn4401between plasmids. We also identify a common insertion site for Tn4401within various Tn2-like elements, suggesting that homologous recombination between Tn2-like elements has enhanced the spread of Tn4401between different plasmid vectors. Furthermore, while short-read sequencing has known limitations for plasmid assembly, various studies have attempted to overcome this with the use of reference-based methods. We also demonstrate that as a consequence of the genetic mobility observed herein, plasmid structures can be extremely dynamic, and therefore these reference-based methods, as well as traditional partial typing methods, can produce very misleading conclusions. Overall, our findings demonstrate that non-clonal resistance gene dissemination can be extremely rapid, presenting significant challenges for public health surveillance and achieving effective control of antibiotic resistance.},

abstract = {Interferons are a family of proteins first identified by their ability to induce cellular resistance to infection by many viruses. In addition to the antiviral properties it shares with the alpha- and beta-interferons, gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma), a lymphokine secreted by activated T cells, activates macrophages, stimulates B cells, increases fibroblast and endothelial cell resistance to many nonviral intracellular parasites and modulates cell-surface proteins central to immune cell regulation. To identify molecules involved in the IFN-gamma response and characterize their modulation, we have isolated genes that are induced following recombinant IFN-gamma treatment of U937 cells, a histiocytic lymphoma cell line with monocytic characteristics. We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of a gene regulated by rIFN-gamma in U937 cells as well as in human mononuclear cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Messenger RNA from this gene is induced within 30 min of rIFN-gamma treatment and demonstrates maximal (greater than 30-fold) accumulation within 5 h. Increased transcription is partly responsible for this accumulation. This gene encodes a protein of relative molecular mass (Mr) 12,378 which has significant amino-acid homology to platelet factor-4 and beta-thromboglobulin, two chemotatic proteins released by platelets on degranulation. This IFN-gamma-inducible protein may be a member of a family of proteins involved in the inflammatory process.},

The resulting subnetworks provide novel hypotheses for pathways involved in tumor progression. Although genes with known breast cancer mutations are typically not detected through analysis of differential expression, they play a central role in the protein network by interconnecting many differentially expressed genes. We find that the subnetwork markers are more reproducible than individual marker genes selected without network information, and that they achieve higher accuracy in the classification of metastatic versus non-metastatic tumors.},

abstract = {Structure-based drug design is now used widely in modern medicinal chemistry. The application of structural biology to medicinal chemistry has heralded the "rational drug design" vision of discovering exquisitely selective ligands. However, recent advances in post-genomic biology are indicating that polypharmacology may be a necessary trait for the efficacy of many drugs, therefore questioning the "one drug, one target" assumption of current rational drug design. By combining advances in chemoinformatics and structural biology, it might be possible to rationally design the next generation of promiscuous drugs with polypharmacology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has emerged as an important opportunistic pathogen, which causes infections that are often difficult to manage because of the inherent resistance of the pathogen to a variety of antimicrobial agents. In this study, we analyzed the expressions of smeABC and smeDEF and their correlation with antimicrobial susceptibility. We also evaluated the genetic relatedness and epidemiological links among 33 isolates of S. maltophilia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: In total, 33 S. maltophilia strains were isolated from patients in a tertiary hospital in Daejeon. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 11 antimicrobial agents were determined by using agar dilution method and E-test (BioM{\'{e}}rieux, France). Real-time PCR analysis was performed to evaluate the expression of the Sme efflux systems in the S. maltophilia isolates. Additionally, an epidemiological investigation was performed using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) assays.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The findings of susceptibility testing showed that the majority of the S. maltophilia isolates were resistant to $\beta$-lactams and aminoglycosides. Twenty-one clinical isolates overexpressed smeABC and showed high resistance to ciprofloxacin. Moreover, a high degree of genetic diversity was observed among the S. maltophilia isolates; 3 sequence types (STs) and 23 allelic profiles were observed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The smeABC efflux pump was associated with multidrug resistance in clinical isolates of S. maltophilia. In particular, smeABC efflux pumps appear to perform an important role in ciprofloxacin resistance of S. maltophilia. The MLST scheme for S. maltophilia represents a discriminatory typing method with stable markers and is appropriate for studying population structures.},

abstract = {Human gene expression traits have been shown to be dependent on gender, age and time of day in blood and other tissues. However, other factors that may impact gene expression have not been systematically explored. For example, in studies linking blood gene expression to obesity related traits, whether the fasted or fed state will be the most informative is an open question. Here, we employed a two-arm cross-over design to perform a genome-wide survey of gene expression in human peripheral blood to address explicitly this type of question. We were able to distinguish expression changes due to individual and time-specific effects from those due to food intake. We demonstrate that the transcriptional response to food intake is robust by constructing a classifier from the gene expression traits with {\textgreater}90{\%} accuracy classifying individuals as being in the fasted or fed state. Gene expression traits that were best able to discriminate the fasted and fed states were more heritable and achieved greater coherence with respect to pathways associated with metabolic traits. The connectivity structure among gene expression traits was explored in the context of coexpression networks. Changes in the connectivity structure were observed between the fasted and fed states. We demonstrate that differential expression and differential connectivity are two complementary ways to characterize changes between fasted and fed states. Both gene sets were significantly enriched for genes associated with obesity related traits. Our results suggest that the pair of fasted/fed blood expression profiles provide more comprehensive information about an individual's metabolic states.},

abstract = {Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous complex disease affecting more than 29 million Americans alone with a rising prevalence trending toward steady increases in the coming decades. Thus, there is a pressing clinical need to improve early prevention and clinical management of T2D and its complications. Clinicians have understood that patients who carry the T2D diagnosis have a variety of phenotypes and susceptibilities to diabetes-related complications. We used a precision medicine approach to characterize the complexity of T2D patient populations based on high-dimensional electronic medical records (EMRs) and genotype data from 11,210 individuals. We successfully identified three distinct subgroups of T2D from topology-based patient-patient networks. Subtype 1 was characterized by T2D complications diabetic nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy; subtype 2 was enriched for cancer malignancy and cardiovascular diseases; and subtype 3 was associated most strongly with cardiovascular diseases, neurological diseases, allergies, and HIV infections. We performed a genetic association analysis of the emergent T2D subtypes to identify subtype-specific genetic markers and identified 1279, 1227, and 1338 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that mapped to 425, 322, and 437 unique genes specific to subtypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. By assessing the human disease-SNP association for each subtype, the enriched phenotypes and biological functions at the gene level for each subtype matched with the disease comorbidities and clinical differences that we identified through EMRs. Our approach demonstrates the utility of applying the precision medicine paradigm in T2D and the promise of extending the approach to the study of other complex, multifactorial diseases.},

abstract = {Information on global human movement patterns is central to spatial epidemiological models used to predict the behavior of influenza and other infectious diseases. Yet it remains difficult to test which modes of dispersal drive pathogen spread at various geographic scales using standard epidemiological data alone. Evolutionary analyses of pathogen genome sequences increasingly provide insights into the spatial dynamics of influenza viruses, but to date they have largely neglected the wealth of information on human mobility, mainly because no statistical framework exists within which viral gene sequences and empirical data on host movement can be combined. Here, we address this problem by applying a phylogeographic approach to elucidate the global spread of human influenza subtype H3N2 and assess its ability to predict the spatial spread of human influenza A viruses worldwide. Using a framework that estimates the migration history of human influenza while simultaneously testing and quantifying a range of potential predictive variables of spatial spread, we show that the global dynamics of influenza H3N2 are driven by air passenger flows, whereas at more local scales spread is also determined by processes that correlate with geographic distance. Our analyses further confirm a central role for mainland China and Southeast Asia in maintaining a source population for global influenza diversity. By comparing model output with the known pandemic expansion of H1N1 during 2009, we demonstrate that predictions of influenza spatial spread are most accurate when data on human mobility and viral evolution are integrated. In conclusion, the global dynamics of influenza viruses are best explained by combining human mobility data with the spatial information inherent in sampled viral genomes. The integrated approach introduced here offers great potential for epidemiological surveillance through phylogeographic reconstructions and for improving predictive models of disease control.},

SEER is applicable to even tens of thousands of genomes by counting variable-length k-mers using a distributed string-mining algorithm. Robust options are provided for association analysis that also correct for the clonal population structure of bacteria. Using large collections of genomes of the major human pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, SEER identifies relevant previously characterised resistance determinants for several antibiotics and discovers potential novel factors related to the invasiveness of S. pyogenes. We thus demonstrate that our method can answer important biologically and medically relevant questions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Several years after sequencing the human genome and the mouse genome, much remains to be discovered about the functions of most human and mouse genes. Computational prediction of gene function promises to help focus limited experimental resources on the most likely hypotheses. Several algorithms using diverse genomic data have been applied to this task in model organisms; however, the performance of such approaches in mammals has not yet been evaluated.

RESULTS:In this study, a standardized collection of mouse functional genomic data was assembled; nine bioinformatics teams used this data set to independently train classifiers and generate predictions of function, as defined by Gene Ontology (GO) terms, for 21,603 mouse genes; and the best performing submissions were combined in a single set of predictions. We identified strengths and weaknesses of current functional genomic data sets and compared the performance of function prediction algorithms. This analysis inferred functions for 76{\%} of mouse genes, including 5,000 currently uncharacterized genes. At a recall rate of 20{\%}, a unified set of predictions averaged 41{\%} precision, with 26{\%} of GO terms achieving a precision better than 90{\%}.

CONCLUSION:We performed a systematic evaluation of diverse, independently developed computational approaches for predicting gene function from heterogeneous data sources in mammals. The results show that currently available data for mammals allows predictions with both breadth and accuracy. Importantly, many highly novel predictions emerge for the 38{\%} of mouse genes that remain uncharacterized.},

Preventing these infections is a national priority, with initiatives led by healthcare organizations, professional associations, government and accrediting agencies, legislators, regulators, payers, and consumer advocacy groups. To assist acute care hospitals in focusing and prioritizing efforts to implement evidence-based practices for prevention of HAIs, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America and the Infectious Diseases Society of America Standards and Practice Guidelines Committee appointed a task force to create a concise compendium of recommendations for the prevention of common HAIs. This compendium is implementation focused and differs from most previously published guidelines in that it highlights a set of basic HAI prevention strategies plus special approaches for use in locations and/or populations within the hospital when infections are not controlled by use of basic practices, recommends that accountability for implementing infection prevention practices be assigned to specific groups and individuals, and includes proposed performance measures for internal quality improvement efforts.},

These SNPs were primarily discovered by two projects: The SNP Consortium and the analysis of clone overlaps by the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium. The map integrates all publicly available SNPs with described genes and other genomic features. We estimate that 60,000 SNPs fall within exon (coding and untranslated regions), and 85{\%} of exons are within 5 kb of the nearest SNP. Nucleotide diversity varies greatly across the genome, in a manner broadly consistent with a standard population genetic model of human history. This high-density SNP map provides a public resource for defining haplotype variation across the genome, and should help to identify biomedically important genes for diagnosis and therapy.},

A necessary component of any such method is the ability to accurately estimate true evolutionary distances between two genomes, which is the number of rearrangement events that took place in the evolutionary history between them. We present a new technique called IEBP, for estimating the true evolutionary distance between two genomes, whether signed or unsigned, circular or linear, and for any relative probabil- ities of rearrangement event classes. The method is highly accurate, as our simulation study shows. This simulation study also shows that the distance estimation technique im- proves the accuracy of the phylogenetic trees reconstructed by the popular distance-based method, neighbor joining},

@phdthesis{Turon2013,
abstract = {The Holy Grail of parallel programming is to provide good speedup while hiding or avoiding the pitfalls of concurrency. But some level in the tower of abstraction must face facts: parallel processors execute code concurrently, and the interplay between concurrent code, synchronization, and the memory subsystem is a major determiner of performance. Effective parallel programming must ultimately be supported by scalable concurrent algorithms -- algorithms that tolerate (or even embrace) concurrency for the sake of scaling with available parallelism. This dissertation makes several contributions to the understanding and expression of such algorithms: It shows how to understand scalable algorithms in terms of local protocols governing each part of their hidden state. These protocols are visual artifacts that can be used to informally explain an algorithm at a whiteboard. But they also play a formal role in a new logic for verifying concurrent algorithms, enabling correctness proofs that are local in space, time, and thread execution. Correctness is stated in terms of refinement: clients of an algorithm can reason as if they were using the much simpler specification code it refines. It shows how to express synchronization in a declarative but scalable way, based on a new library providing "join patterns". By declarative, we mean that the programmer needs only to write down the constraints of a synchronization problem, and the library will automatically derive a correct solution. By scalable, we mean that the derived solutions deliver robust performance with increasing processor count and problem complexity. For common synchronization problems, join patterns perform as well as specialized algorithms from the literature. It shows how to express scalable algorithms through "reagents", a new monadic abstraction. With reagents, algorithms no longer need to be constructed from "whole cloth," i.e. by using system-level primitives directly. Instead, they are built using a mixture of shared-state and message-passing combinators. Concurrency experts benefit, because they can write libraries at a higher level, with more reuse, without sacrificing scalability. Their clients benefit, because composition empowers them to extend and tailor a library without knowing the details of its underlying algorithms.},

abstract = {CONTEXT:Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that stop earlier than planned because of apparent benefit often receive great attention and affect clinical practice. Their prevalence, the magnitude and plausibility of their treatment effects, and the extent to which they report information about how investigators decided to stop early are, however, unknown.

OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the epidemiology and reporting quality of RCTs involving interventions stopped early for benefit.

DATA SOURCES:Systematic review up to November 2004 of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents, and full-text journal content databases to identify RCTs stopped early for benefit.

STUDY SELECTION:Randomized clinical trials of any intervention reported as having stopped early because of results favoring the intervention. There were no exclusion criteria.

DATA EXTRACTION:Twelve reviewers working independently and in duplicate abstracted data on content area and type of intervention tested, reporting of funding, type of end point driving study termination, treatment effect, length of follow-up, estimated sample size and total sample studied, role of a data and safety monitoring board in stopping the study, number of interim analyses planned and conducted, and existence and type of monitoring methods, statistical boundaries, and adjustment procedures for interim analyses and early stopping.

DATA SYNTHESIS:Of 143 RCTs stopped early for benefit, the majority (92) were published in 5 high-impact medical journals. Typically, these were industry-funded drug trials in cardiology, cancer, and human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS. The proportion of all RCTs published in high-impact journals that were stopped early for benefit increased from 0.5{\%} in 1990-1994 to 1.2{\%} in 2000-2004 (P{\textless}.001 for trend). On average, RCTs recruited 63{\%} (SD, 25{\%}) of the planned sample and stopped after a median of 13 (interquartile range [IQR], 3-25) months of follow-up, 1 interim analysis, and when a median of 66 (IQR, 23-195) patients had experienced the end point driving study termination (event). The median risk ratio among truncated RCTs was 0.53 (IQR, 0.28-0.66). One hundred thirty-five (94{\%}) of the 143 RCTs did not report at least 1 of the following: the planned sample size (n = 28), the interim analysis after which the trial was stopped (n = 45), whether a stopping rule informed the decision (n = 48), or an adjusted analysis accounting for interim monitoring and truncation (n = 129). Trials with fewer events yielded greater treatment effects (odds ratio, 28; 95{\%} confidence interval, 11-73).

CONCLUSIONS:RCTs stopped early for benefit are becoming more common, often fail to adequately report relevant information about the decision to stop early, and show implausibly large treatment effects, particularly when the number of events is small. These findings suggest clinicians should view the results of such trials with skepticism.},

@article{Risso2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become the assay of choice for high-throughput studies of gene expression. However, as is the case with microarrays, major technology-related artifacts and biases affect the resulting expression measures. Normalization is therefore essential to ensure accurate inference of expression levels and subsequent analyses thereof.

RESULTS: We focus on biases related to GC-content and demonstrate the existence of strong sample-specific GC-content effects on RNA-Seq read counts, which can substantially bias differential expression analysis. We propose three simple within-lane gene-level GC-content normalization approaches and assess their performance on two different RNA-Seq datasets, involving different species and experimental designs. Our methods are compared to state-of-the-art normalization procedures in terms of bias and mean squared error for expression fold-change estimation and in terms of Type I error and p-value distributions for tests of differential expression. The exploratory data analysis and normalization methods proposed in this article are implemented in the open-source Bioconductor R package EDASeq.

CONCLUSIONS: Our within-lane normalization procedures, followed by between-lane normalization, reduce GC-content bias and lead to more accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential expression. Such results are crucial for the biological interpretation of RNA-Seq experiments, where downstream analyses can be sensitive to the supplied lists of genes.},

abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression {\&} path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates.},

abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV), and related flaviviruses such as tick-borne encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever and dengue viruses, constitute a significant global human health problem. However, our understanding of the molecular interaction of such flaviviruses with mammalian host cells is limited. WNV encodes only 10 proteins, implying that it may use many cellular proteins for infection. WNV enters the cytoplasm through pH-dependent endocytosis, undergoes cycles of translation and replication, assembles progeny virions in association with endoplasmic reticulum, and exits along the secretory pathway. RNA interference (RNAi) presents a powerful forward genetics approach to dissect virus-host cell interactions. Here we report the identification of 305 host proteins that affect WNV infection, using a human-genome-wide RNAi screen. Functional clustering of the genes revealed a complex dependence of this virus on host cell physiology, requiring a wide variety of molecules and cellular pathways for successful infection. We further demonstrate a requirement for the ubiquitin ligase CBLL1 in WNV internalization, a post-entry role for the endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation pathway in viral infection, and the monocarboxylic acid transporter MCT4 as a viral replication resistance factor. By extending this study to dengue virus, we show that flaviviruses have both overlapping and unique interaction strategies with host cells. This study provides a comprehensive molecular portrait of WNV-human cell interactions that forms a model for understanding single plus-stranded RNA virus infection, and reveals potential antiviral targets.},

Fortunately, the fast-growing number of fully sequenced bacterial strains now enables us to develop new methods to identify mutations associated with drug resistance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We present a new comparative approach to identify genes and mutations that are likely to be associated with drug resistance mechanisms. In order to test the approach, we collected genotype and phenotype data of 100 fully sequenced strains of S. aureus and 10 commonly used drugs. Then, applying the method, we re-discovered the most common genetic determinants of drug resistance and identified some novel putative associations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Firstly, the collected data may help other researchers to develop and verify similar techniques. Secondly, the proposed method is successful in identifying drug resistance determinants. Thirdly, the in-silico identified genetic mutations, which are putatively involved in drug resistance mechanisms, may increase our understanding of the drug resistance mechanisms.},

abstract = {The NS1 protein of influenza A virus (NS1A protein) is a multifunctional protein that counters cellular antiviral activities and is a virulence factor. Its N-terminal RNA-binding domain binds dsRNA. The only amino acid absolutely required for dsRNA binding is the R at position 38. To identify the role of this dsRNA-binding activity during influenza A virus infection, we generated a recombinant influenza A/Udorn/72 virus expressing an NS1A protein containing an RNA-binding domain in which R38 is mutated to A. This R38A mutant virus is highly attenuated, and the mutant NS1A protein, like the WT protein, is localized in the nucleus. Using the R38A mutant virus, we establish that dsRNA binding by the NS1A protein does not inhibit production of IFN-beta mRNA. Rather, we demonstrate that the primary role of this dsRNA-binding activity is to protect the virus against the antiviral state induced by IFN-beta. Pretreatment of A549 cells with IFN-beta for 6 h did not inhibit replication of WT Udorn virus, whereas replication of R38A mutant virus was inhibited 1,000-fold. Using both RNA interference in A549 cells and mouse knockout cells, we show that this enhanced sensitivity to IFN-beta-induced antiviral activity is due predominantly to the activation of RNase L. Because activation of RNase L is totally dependent on dsRNA activation of 2'-5' oligo (A) synthetase (OAS), it is likely that the primary role of dsRNA binding by the NS1A protein in virus-infected cells is to sequester dsRNA away from 2'-5' OAS.},

Unlike other members of the alphavirus genus, immune responses to Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) have been poorly investigated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We conducted a large ex vivo multiplex study of 50 cytokine, chemokine, and growth factor plasma profiles in 69 acutely infected patients from the Gabonese outbreak of 2007. We also assessed a phenotypic study of T lymphocyte responses during human acute CHIKV infection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: CHIKV infection in humans elicited strong innate immunity involving the production of numerous proinflammatory mediators. Interestingly, high levels of Interferon (IFN) $\alpha$ were consistently found. Production of interleukin (IL) 4, IL-10, and IFN-$\gamma$ suggested the engagement of the adaptive immunity. This was confirmed by flow cytometry of circulating T lymphocytes that showed a CD8+ T lymphocyte response in the early stages of the disease, and a CD4+ T lymphocyte mediated response in the later stages. For the first time to our knowledge, we found evidence of CD95-mediated apoptosis of CD4+ T lymphocytes during the first 2 days after symptoms onset, ex vivo.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Together, our findings suggest that strong innate immunity is required to control CHIKV infection.},

abstract = {Therapeutics that are designed to engage RNA interference (RNAi) pathways have the potential to provide new, major ways of imparting therapy to patients. Long, double-stranded RNAs were first shown to mediate RNAi in Caenorhabditis elegans, and the potential use of RNAi for human therapy has been demonstrated by the finding that small interfering RNAs (siRNAs; approximately 21-base-pair double-stranded RNA) can elicit RNAi in mammalian cells without producing an interferon response. We are at present conducting the first in-human phase I clinical trial involving the systemic administration of siRNA to patients with solid cancers using a targeted, nanoparticle delivery system. Here we provide evidence of inducing an RNAi mechanism of action in a human from the delivered siRNA. Tumour biopsies from melanoma patients obtained after treatment show the presence of intracellularly localized nanoparticles in amounts that correlate with dose levels of the nanoparticles administered (this is, to our knowledge, a first for systemically delivered nanoparticles of any kind). Furthermore, a reduction was found in both the specific messenger RNA (M2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RRM2)) and the protein (RRM2) levels when compared to pre-dosing tissue. Most notably, we detect the presence of an mRNA fragment that demonstrates that siRNA-mediated mRNA cleavage occurs specifically at the site predicted for an RNAi mechanism from a patient who received the highest dose of the nanoparticles. Together, these data demonstrate that siRNA administered systemically to a human can produce a specific gene inhibition (reduction in mRNA and protein) by an RNAi mechanism of action.},

We used CyTOF to evaluate T cells infected with varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection, documenting virus-mediated phenotypic and functional changes caused by this T cell tropic human herpesvirus. Here we summarize our findings using two complementary panels of antibodies against surface and intracellular signaling proteins to elucidate the consequences of VZV-mediated perturbations on the surface and in signaling networks of infected T cells. CyTOF data was analyzed by several statistical, analytical and visualization tools including hierarchical clustering, orthogonal scaling, SPADE, viSNE, and SLIDE. Data from the mass cytometry studies demonstrated that VZV infection led to 'remodeling' of the surface architecture of T cells, promoting skin trafficking phenotypes and associated with concomitant activation of T-cell receptor and PI3-kinase pathways. This method offers a novel approach for understanding viral interactions with differentiated host cells important for pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Background: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is most commonly diagnosed using toxin enzyme immunoassays (EIAs). A sudden decrease in CDI incidence was noted after a change in the EIA used at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St Louis. The objective of this study was to determine whether the decreased CDI incidence related to the change in EIA resulted in adverse patient outcomes. Methods: Electronic hospital databases were used to collect data on demographics, outcomes, and treatment of inpatients who had a C difficile toxin assay performed between January 4, 2009, and April 3, 2009 (period A, preassay change) and between May 21, 2009, and August 17, 2009 (period B, postassay change). Results: Assays were positive in 240 of 1,221 patients (19.7{\%}) during period A and in 106 of 1160 patients (9.1{\%}) during period B (P {\textless}.01). There was no difference in mortality or discharge to hospice between the 2 periods (10.3{\%} vs 10.1{\%}; P =.90). Patients tested in period B were less likely to receive metronidazole or oral vancomycin (P {\textless}.01). Conclusions: The new EIA resulted in fewer positive tests and reduced anti-CDI therapy. There was no difference in mortality between the 2 periods, suggesting that the decreased incidence was due to increased assay specificity, not decreased sensitivity. ?? 2012 by the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Testing for correlations between different sets of genomic features is a fundamental task in genomics research. However, searching for overlaps between features with existing web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these data in an efficient manner.

RESULTS: This article introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: BEDTools was written in C++. Source code and a comprehensive user manual are freely available at http://code.google.com/p/bedtools

abstract = {PURPOSE To examine the difference between rural and urban hospitals as to their overall level of readiness for stage 2 meaningful use of electronic health records (EHRs) and to identify other key factors that affect their readiness for stage 2 meaningful use. METHODS A conceptual framework based on the theory of organizational readiness for change was used in a cross-sectional multivariate analysis using 2,083 samples drawn from the HIMSS Analytics survey conducted with US hospitals in 2013. FINDINGS Rural hospitals were less likely to be ready for stage 2 meaningful use compared to urban hospitals in the United States (OR = 0.49) in our final model. Hospitals' past experience with an information exchange initiative, staff size in the information system department, and the Chief Information Officer (CIO)'s responsibility for health information management were identified as the most critical organizational contextual factors that were associated with hospitals' readiness for stage 2. Rural hospitals lag behind urban hospitals in EHR adoption, which will hinder the interoperability of EHRs among providers across the nation. The identification of critical factors that relate to the adoption of EHR systems provides insights into possible organizational change efforts that can help hospitals to succeed in attaining meaningful use requirements. CONCLUSION Rural hospitals have increasingly limited resources, which have resulted in a struggle for these facilities to attain meaningful use. Given increasing closures among rural hospitals, it is all the more important that EHR development focus on advancing rural hospital quality of care and linkages with patients and other organizations supporting the care of their patients.},

The age distribution of dengue cases and the circulating serotype (predominantly DEN2) were representative of national data. Similar results were obtained when either dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome or its principal manifestations (vascular permeability, internal hemorrhage, marked thrombocytopenia, and/or shock) were analyzed in relation to age and immune status. The burden of disease and of severe dengue was found predominantly in infants 4-9 months of age and in children 5-9 years old, and secondary DEN infection was a risk factor for severity in children. Age-related differences were identified in the prevalence of specific clinical manifestations as well as in their association with a confirmed DEN diagnosis. This represents one of the few comprehensive studies to analyze characteristics of dengue in infants, children, and adults in the same population and highlights age-related differences in dengue severity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) belonging to a single lineage are often indistinguishable by means of current typing techniques. Whole-genome sequencing may provide improved resolution to define transmission pathways and characterize outbreaks. METHODS: We investigated a putative MRSA outbreak in a neonatal intensive care unit. By using rapid high-throughput sequencing technology with a clinically relevant turnaround time, we retrospectively sequenced the DNA from seven isolates associated with the outbreak and another seven MRSA isolates associated with carriage of MRSA or bacteremia in the same hospital. RESULTS: We constructed a phylogenetic tree by comparing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the core genome to a reference genome (an epidemic MRSA clone, EMRSA-15 [sequence type 22]). This revealed a distinct cluster of outbreak isolates and clear separation between these and the nonoutbreak isolates. A previously missed transmission event was detected between two patients with bacteremia who were not part of the outbreak. We created an artificial "resistome" of antibiotic-resistance genes and demonstrated concordance between it and the results of phenotypic susceptibility testing; we also created a "toxome" consisting of toxin genes. One outbreak isolate had a hypermutator phenotype with a higher number of SNPs than the other outbreak isolates, highlighting the difficulty of imposing a simple threshold for the number of SNPs between isolates to decide whether they are part of a recent transmission chain. CONCLUSIONS: Whole-genome sequencing can provide clinically relevant data within a time frame that can influence patient care. The need for automated data interpretation and the provision of clinically meaningful reports represent hurdles to clinical implementation.

abstract = {Bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST-2) also known as Tetherin) is an interferon-inducible gene that functions to block the release of a range of nascent enveloped virions from infected host cells. However, the role of BST-2 in viral pathogenesis remains poorly understood. BST-2 plays a multifaceted role in innate immunity-as it hinders retroviral infection and possibly promotes infection with some rhabdo and orthomyxo viruses. This paradoxical role has probably hindered exploration of BST-2 antiviral function in vivo. We previously reported that BST-2 tethers Chikungunya virus-like particle on the cell plasma membrane. To explore the role of BST-2 in Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) replication and host protection, we utilized Chikungunya virus strain 181/25 to examine early events during CHIKV infection in BST-2-/- mouse model. We observed interesting dichotomy between wild-type (WT) and BST-2-/- mice. BST-2 deficiency increased inoculation site viral load, culminating in higher systemic viremia and increased lymphoid tissues tropism. Suppressed inflammatory innate response demonstrated by impaired IFN$\alpha$, IFN$\gamma$, and CD40 ligand (CD40L) expression was observed in BST-2-/- mice compared to the WT controls. These findings suggest that, in part, BST-2 protects lymphoid tissues from CHIKV infection and regulates CHIKV-induced inflammatory response by the host.},

Here, we describe the current PANTHER process as a whole, as well as the website tools for analysis of user-uploaded data. The main goals of PANTHER remain essentially unchanged: the accurate inference (and practical application) of gene and protein function over large sequence databases, using phylogenetic trees to extrapolate from the relatively sparse experimental information from a few model organisms. Yet the focus of PANTHER has continually shifted toward more accurate and detailed representations of evolutionary events in gene family histories. The trees are now designed to represent gene family evolution, including inference of evolutionary events, such as speciation and gene duplication. Subfamilies are still curated and used to define HMMs, but gene ontology functional annotations can now be made at any node in the tree, and are designed to represent gain and loss of function by ancestral genes during evolution. Finally, PANTHER now includes stable database identifiers for inferred ancestral genes, which are used to associate inferred gene attributes with particular genes in the common ancestral genomes of extant species.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The program eBURST uses multilocus sequence typing data to divide bacterial populations into groups of closely related strains (clonal complexes), predicts the founding genotype of each group, and displays the patterns of recent evolutionary descent of all other strains in the group from the founder. The reliability of eBURST was evaluated using populations simulated with different levels of recombination in which the ancestry of all strains was known. RESULTS: For strictly clonal simulations, where all allelic change is due to point mutation, the groups of related strains identified by eBURST were very similar to those expected from the true ancestry and most of the true ancestor-descendant relationships (90-98{\%}) were identified by eBURST. Populations simulated with low or moderate levels of recombination showed similarly high performance but the reliability of eBURST declined with increasing recombination to mutation ratio. Populations simulated under a high recombination to mutation ratio were dominated by a single large straggly eBURST group, which resulted from the incorrect linking of unrelated groups of strains into the same eBURST group. The reliability of the ancestor-descendant links in eBURST diagrams was related to the proportion of strains in the largest eBURST group, which provides a useful guide to when eBURST is likely to be unreliable. CONCLUSION: Examination of eBURST groups within populations of a range of bacterial species showed that most were within the range in which eBURST is reliable, and only a small number (e.g. Burkholderia pseudomallei and Enterococcus faecium) appeared to have such high rates of recombination that eBURST is likely to be unreliable. The study also demonstrates how three simple tests in eBURST v3 can be used to detect unreliable eBURST performance and recognise populations in which there appears to be a high rate of recombination relative to mutation.},

However, they include some redundant and useless features. It is essential to select the most representative feature subset; this contributes to improving the classification accuracy. We propose a novel feature selection method based on a genetic algorithm, according to the characteristics of human pre-miRNAs. The information gain of a feature, the feature conservation relative to stem parts of pre-miRNA, and the redundancy among features are all considered. Feature conservation was introduced for the first time. Experimental results were validated by cross-validation using datasets composed of human real/pseudo pre-miRNAs. Compared with microPred, our classifier miPredGA, achieved more reliable sensitivity and specificity. The accuracy was improved nearly 12{\%}. The feature selection algorithm is useful for constructing more efficient classifiers for identification of real human pre-miRNAs from pseudo hairpins.},

The emergence of strains resistant to carbapenems has left few treatment options, making infection containment critical. In 2011, the U.S. National Institutes of Health Clinical Center experienced an outbreak of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae that affected 18 patients, 11 of whom died. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on K. pneumoniae isolates to gain insight into why the outbreak progressed despite early implementation of infection control procedures. Integrated genomic and epidemiological analysis traced the outbreak to three independent transmissions from a single patient who was discharged 3 weeks before the next case became clinically apparent. Additional genomic comparisons provided evidence for unexpected transmission routes, with subsequent mining of epidemiological data pointing to possible explanations for these transmissions. Our analysis demonstrates that integration of genomic and epidemiological data can yield actionable insights and facilitate the control of nosocomial transmission.},

abstract = {Numerous studies have divided blood monocytes according to their expression of the surface markers CD14 and CD16 into following subsets: classical CD14(++)CD16(-), intermediate CD14(++)CD16(+) and nonclassical CD14(+)CD16(++) monocytes. These subsets differ in phenotype and function and are further correlated to cardiovascular disease, inflammation and cancer. However, the CD14/CD16 nature of resident monocytes in human bone marrow remains largely unknown. In the present study, we identified a major population of CD14(++)CD16(+) monocytes by using cryopreserved bone marrow mononuclear cells from healthy donors. These cells express essential monocyte-related antigens and chemokine receptors such as CD11a, CD18, CD44, HLA-DR, Ccr2, Ccr5, Cx3cr1, Cxcr2 and Cxcr4. Notably, the expression of Ccr2 was inducible during culture. Furthermore, sorted CD14(++)CD16(+) bone marrow cells show typical macrophage morphology, phagocytic activity, angiogenic features and generation of intracellular oxygen species. Side-by-side comparison of the chemokine receptor profile with unpaired blood samples also demonstrated that these rather premature medullar monocytes mainly match the phenotype of intermediate and partially of (non)classical monocytes. Together, human monocytes obviously acquire their definitive CD14/CD16 signature in the bloodstream and the medullar monocytes probably transform into CD14(++)CD16- and CD14(+)CD16(++) subsets which appear enriched in the periphery.},

abstract = {The emergence of the unique H1N1 influenza A virus in 2009 resulted in a pandemic that has spread to over 200 countries. The constellation of molecular factors leading to the emergence of this strain is still unclear. Using a computational approach, we identified molecular determinants that may discriminate the hemagglutinin protein of the 2009 human pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) strain from that of other H1N1 strains. As expected, positions discriminating the pH1N1 from seasonal human strains were located in or near known H1N1 antigenic sites, thus camouflaging the pH1N1 strain from immune recognition. For example, the alteration S145K (an antigenic position) was found as a characteristic of the pH1N1 strain. We also detected positions in the hemagglutinin protein differentiating classical swine viruses from pH1N1. These positions were mostly located in and around the receptor-binding pocket, possibly influencing binding affinity to the human cell. Such alterations may be liable in part for the virus's efficient infection and adaptation to humans. For instance, 133(A) and 149 were identified as discriminative positions. Significantly, we showed that the substitutions R133(A)K and R149K, predicted to be pH1N1 characteristics, each altered virus binding to erythrocytes and conferred virulence to A/swine/NC/18161/02 in mice, reinforcing the computational findings. Our findings provide a structural explanation for the deficient immunity of humans to the pH1N1 strain. Moreover, our analysis points to unique molecular factors that may have facilitated the emergence of this swine variant in humans, in contrast to other swine variants that failed.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-three S. maltophilia clinical isolates were studied. PCR and direct sequencing were used to detect the presence of integrons. Real-time PCR was performed to assess and quantify the expression of the Sme efflux pumps of S. maltophilia. RESULTS: Class 1 integrons were detected in 22{\%} of clinical isolates and carried cassettes conferring resistance mainly to aminoglycosides and trimethoprim. The small multidrug resistance gene, smr, was found on class 1 integrons in six isolates. Thirty-one percent of the isolates overexpressed the smeDEF gene, as compared with a control strain, and 59{\%} overexpressed the smeABC gene. Extrusion of ciprofloxacin and meropenem was specific to the SmeABC and SmeDEF pumps, respectively. CONCLUSION: SmeABC and SmeDEF efflux pumps play important roles in resistance of S. maltophilia to ciprofloxacin and meropenem.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves new drugs based on sponsor-submitted clinical trials. The publication status of these trials in the medical literature and factors associated with publication have not been evaluated. We sought to determine the proportion of trials submitted to the FDA in support of newly approved drugs that are published in biomedical journals that a typical clinician, consumer, or policy maker living in the US would reasonably search.

METHODS AND FINDINGS:We conducted a cohort study of trials supporting new drugs approved between 1998 and 2000, as described in FDA medical and statistical review documents and the FDA approved drug label. We determined publication status and time from approval to full publication in the medical literature at 2 and 5 y by searching PubMed and other databases through 01 August 2006. We then evaluated trial characteristics associated with publication. We identified 909 trials supporting 90 approved drugs in the FDA reviews, of which 43{\%} (394/909) were published. Among the subset of trials described in the FDA-approved drug label and classified as "pivotal trials" for our analysis, 76{\%} (257/340) were published. In multivariable logistic regression for all trials 5 y postapproval, likelihood of publication correlated with statistically significant results (odds ratio [OR] 3.03, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.78-5.17); larger sample sizes (OR 1.33 per 2-fold increase in sample size, 95{\%} CI 1.17-1.52); and pivotal status (OR 5.31, 95{\%} CI 3.30-8.55). In multivariable logistic regression for only the pivotal trials 5 y postapproval, likelihood of publication correlated with statistically significant results (OR 2.96, 95{\%} CI 1.24-7.06) and larger sample sizes (OR 1.47 per 2-fold increase in sample size, 95{\%} CI 1.15-1.88). Statistically significant results and larger sample sizes were also predictive of publication at 2 y postapproval and in multivariable Cox proportional models for all trials and the subset of pivotal trials.

CONCLUSIONS:Over half of all supporting trials for FDA-approved drugs remained unpublished {\textgreater}/= 5 y after approval. Pivotal trials and trials with statistically significant results and larger sample sizes are more likely to be published. Selective reporting of trial results exists for commonly marketed drugs. Our data provide a baseline for evaluating publication bias as the new FDA Amendments Act comes into force mandating basic results reporting of clinical trials.},

This bacteraemia is resistant to sulphonamides, or fluoroquinolones, while the representative strain of S. maltophilia, K279a, is sensitive to both. To explore drug resistance determinants of this strain, the draft genome sequence of WJ66 was determined and compared to other S. maltophilia sequences. Genome sequencing and genome-wide evolutionary analysis revealed that WJ66 was highly homologous with the strain K279a, but strain WJ66 contained additional antibiotic resistance genes. Further analysis confirmed that strain WJ66 contained an amino acid substitution (Q83L) in fluoroquinolone target GyrA and carried a class 1 integron, with an aadA2 gene in the resistance gene cassette. Homology analysis from the pathogen-host interaction database showed that strain WJ66 lacks raxST and raxA, which is consistent with K279a. Comparative genomic analyses revealed that subtle nucleotide differences contribute to various significant phenotypes in close genetic relationship strains.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prediction of bacterial infections and their pathogens allows for early, directed investigation and treatment. We assessed the ability of TREAT, a computerized decision support system, to predict specific pathogens.

METHODS: TREAT uses data available within the first few hours of infection presentation in a causal probabilistic network to predict sites of infection and specific pathogens. We included 3529 patients (920 with microbiologically documented infections) participating in the observational and interventional trials of the TREAT system in Israel, Germany and Italy. Discriminatory performance of TREAT to predict individual pathogens was expressed by the AUC with 95{\%} confidence intervals. Calibration was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic.

RESULTS: The AUCs for Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli, ranged between 0.70 and 0.80 (all significant). Adequate calibration was demonstrated for any Gram-negative infection and individual bacteria, except for E. coli. Discrimination and calibration were acceptable for Enterococcus spp. (AUC 0.71, 0.65-0.78), but not for Staphylococcus aureus (AUC 0.63, 0.55-0.71). The few infections caused by Candida spp. and Clostridium difficile were well predicted (AUCs 0.74, 0.54-0.95; and 0.94, 0.88-1.00, respectively). The coverage with TREAT's recommendation exceeded that observed with physicians' treatment for all pathogens, except Candida spp.

CONCLUSIONS: TREAT predicted individual pathogens causing infection well. Prediction of S. aureus was inferior to that observed with other pathogens. TREAT can be used to triage patients by the risk for specific pathogens. The system's predictions enable it to prescribe appropriate antibiotic treatment prior to pathogen identification.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Inpatient length of stay (LOS) has been used as a measure of hospital quality and efficiency. Patients with Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) have longer LOS. OBJECTIVE To describe the relationship between hospital CDI incidence and the LOS of patients without CDI. DESIGN Retrospective cohort analysis. METHODS We predicted average LOS for patients without CDI at both the hospital and patient level using hospital CDI incidence. We also controlled for hospital characteristics (eg, bed size) and patient characteristics (eg, comorbidities, age). SETTING Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 2009-2011. PATIENTS The Nationwide Inpatient Sample includes patients from a 20{\%} sample of all nonfederal US hospitals. RESULTS Inpatient LOS was significantly longer (P{\textless}.001) at hospitals with greater CDI incidence at both the hospital and individual level. At a hospital level, a percentage point increase in the CDI incidence rate was associated with more than an additional day's stay (between 1.19 and 1.61 days). At the individual level, controlling for all observable variables, a percentage point increase in the CDI incidence rate at their hospital was also associated with longer LOS (between 0.6 and 1.05 additional days). Hospital CDI incidence had a larger impact on LOS than many other commonly used predictors of LOS. CONCLUSION CDI rates are a predictor of LOS in patients without CDI at an individual and institutional level. CDI rates are easy to measure and report and thus may provide an important marker for hospital efficiency and/or quality. Infect. Control Hosp. Epidemiol. 2016;37(4):404-410.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has increased to epidemic proportions in recent years. The carriage of C. difficile among healthy adults and hospital inpatients has been established. We sought to determine whether C. difficile colonization exists among healthcare workers (HCWs) in our setting.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A point prevalence study of stool colonization with C. difficile among doctors, nurses and allied health staff at a large regional teaching hospital in Geelong, Victoria. All participants completed a short questionnaire and all stool specimens were tested by Techlab{\textregistered} C.diff Quik Check enzyme immunoassay followed by enrichment culture.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Among 128 healthcare workers, 77{\%} were female, of mean age 43 years, and the majority were nursing staff (73{\%}). Nineteen HCWs (15{\%}) reported diarrhoea, and 12 (9{\%}) had taken antibiotics in the previous six weeks. Over 40{\%} of participants reported having contact with a patient with known or suspected CDI in the 6 weeks before the stool was collected. C. difficile was not isolated from the stool of any participants.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Although HCWs are at risk of asymptomatic carriage and could act as a reservoir for transmission in the hospital environment, with the use of a screening test and culture we were unable to identify C. difficile in the stool of our participants in a non-outbreak setting. This may reflect potential colonization resistance of the gut microbiota, or the success of infection prevention strategies at our institution.},

abstract = {The eukaryotic RNA exosome is an essential, multi-subunit complex that catalyzes RNA turnover, maturation, and quality control processes. Its non-catalytic donut-shaped core includes 9 subunits that associate with the 3' to 5' exoribonucleases Rrp6, and Rrp44/Dis3, a subunit that also catalyzes endoribonuclease activity. Although recent structures and biochemical studies of RNA bound exosomes from S. cerevisiae revealed that the Exo9 central channel guides RNA to either Rrp6 or Rrp44 using partially overlapping and mutually exclusive paths, several issues related to RNA recruitment remain. Here, we identify activities for the highly basic Rrp6 C-terminal tail that we term the 'lasso' because it binds RNA and stimulates ribonuclease activities associated with Rrp44 and Rrp6 within the 11-subunit nuclear exosome. Stimulation is dependent on the Exo9 central channel, and the lasso contributes to degradation and processing activities of exosome substrates in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we present evidence that the Rrp6 lasso may be a conserved feature of the eukaryotic RNA exosome.},

abstract = {Human infection by H7N9 influenza virus was first identified in China in March 2013. As of 12 August 2013, a total of 135 documented cases with 44 fatalities had been reported. Genetic and laboratory analyses of the novel H7N9 viruses isolated from patients indicate that these viruses possess several polymerase gene mutations previously associated with human adaptation and potential pandemic capabilities. However, the function of these mutations in the emergence and pathogenicity of the viruses is not well known. In this study, we demonstrate that the PB2 E627K mutation, which occurs in over 70 {\%} of the H7N9 patient isolates, promotes the replication of H7N9 virus by enhancing PB2 polymerase activity and enhances virulence in mice. Our results show the PB2 E627K mutation has played an important role in this H7N9 influenza outbreak and in the pathogenicity of the H7N9 virus.},

abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV) is a re-emerging pathogen and the leading cause of epidemic encephalitis in the United States. Inflammatory monocytes are a critical component of the cellular infiltrate found in the CNS during WNV encephalitis, although the molecular cues involved in their migration are not fully understood. In mice, we previously showed that WNV infection induces a CCR2-dependent monocytosis that precedes monocyte migration into the CNS. Currently, the relative contribution of the CCR2 ligands, chemokines CCL2 and CCL7, in directing monocyte mobilization and leukocyte migration into the CNS is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that, although both CCL2 and CCL7 are required for efficient monocytosis and monocyte accumulation in the CNS, only CCL7 deficiency resulted in increased viral burden in the brain and enhanced mortality. The enhanced susceptibility in the absence of CCL7 was associated with the delayed migration of neutrophils and CD8(+) T cells into the CNS compared with WT or Ccl2(-/-) mice. To determine whether CCL7 reconstitution could therapeutically alter the survival outcome of WNV infection, we administered exogenous CCL7 i.v. to WNV-infected Ccl7(-/-) mice and observed a significant increase in monocytes and neutrophils, but not CD8(+) T cells, within the CNS, as well as an enhancement in survival compared with Ccl7(-/-) mice treated with a linear CCL7 control peptide. Our experiments suggest that CCL7 is an important protective signal involved in leukocyte trafficking during WNV infection, and it may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of acute viral infections of the CNS.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have demonstrated the ability to identify the strongest causal common variants in complex human diseases. However, to date, the massive data generated from GWAS have not been maximally explored to identify true associations that fail to meet the stringent level of association required to achieve genome-wide significance. Genetics of gene expression (GGE) studies have shown promise towards identifying DNA variations associated with disease and providing a path to functionally characterize findings from GWAS. Here, we present the first empiric study to systematically characterize the set of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with expression (eSNPs) in liver, subcutaneous fat, and omental fat tissues, demonstrating these eSNPs are significantly more enriched for SNPs that associate with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in three large-scale GWAS than a matched set of randomly selected SNPs. This enrichment for T2D association increases as we restrict to eSNPs that correspond to genes comprising gene networks constructed from adipose gene expression data isolated from a mouse population segregating a T2D phenotype. Finally, by restricting to eSNPs corresponding to genes comprising an adipose subnetwork strongly predicted as causal for T2D, we dramatically increased the enrichment for SNPs associated with T2D and were able to identify a functionally related set of diabetes susceptibility genes. We identified and validated malic enzyme 1 (Me1) as a key regulator of this T2D subnetwork in mouse and provided support for the association of this gene to T2D in humans. This integration of eSNPs and networks provides a novel approach to identify disease susceptibility networks rather than the single SNPs or genes traditionally identified through GWAS, thereby extracting additional value from the wealth of data currently being generated by GWAS.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In recent years, the number of human infections caused by opportunistic pathogens has increased dramatically. Plant rhizospheres are one of the most typical natural reservoirs for these pathogens but they also represent a great source for beneficial microbes with potential for biotechnological applications. However, understanding the natural variation and possible differences between pathogens and beneficials is the main challenge in furthering these possibilities. The genus Stenotrophomonas contains representatives found to be associated with human and plant host.

RESULTS: We used comparative genomics as well as transcriptomic and physiological approaches to detect significant borders between the Stenotrophomonas strains: the multi-drug resistant pathogenic S. maltophilia and the plant-associated strains S. maltophilia R551-3 and S. rhizophila DSM14405T (both are biocontrol agents). We found an overall high degree of sequence similarity between the genomes of all three strains. Despite the notable similarity in potential factors responsible for host invasion and antibiotic resistance, other factors including several crucial virulence factors and heat shock proteins were absent in the plant-associated DSM14405T. Instead, S. rhizophila DSM14405T possessed unique genes for the synthesis and transport of the plant-protective spermidine, plant cell-wall degrading enzymes, and high salinity tolerance. Moreover, the presence or absence of bacterial growth at 37°C was identified as a very simple method in differentiating between pathogenic and non-pathogenic isolates. DSM14405T is not able to grow at this human-relevant temperature, most likely in great part due to the absence of heat shock genes and perhaps also because of the up-regulation at increased temperatures of several genes involved in a suicide mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS: While this study is important for understanding the mechanisms behind the emerging pattern of infectious diseases, it is, to our knowledge, the first of its kind to assess the risk of beneficial strains for biotechnological applications. We identified certain traits typical of pathogens such as growth at the human body temperature together with the production of heat shock proteins as opposed to a temperature-regulated suicide system that is harnessed by beneficials.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:New prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses are needed. We generated neutralizing anti-H5N1 human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and tested their efficacy for prophylaxis and therapy in a murine model of infection.

METHODS AND FINDINGS:Using Epstein-Barr virus we immortalized memory B cells from Vietnamese adults who had recovered from infections with HPAI H5N1 viruses. Supernatants from B cell lines were screened in a virus neutralization assay. B cell lines secreting neutralizing antibodies were cloned and the mAbs purified. The cross-reactivity of these antibodies for different strains of H5N1 was tested in vitro by neutralization assays, and their prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in vivo was tested in mice. In vitro, mAbs FLA3.14 and FLD20.19 neutralized both Clade I and Clade II H5N1 viruses, whilst FLA5.10 and FLD21.140 neutralized Clade I viruses only. In vivo, FLA3.14 and FLA5.10 conferred protection from lethality in mice challenged with A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) in a dose-dependent manner. mAb prophylaxis provided a statistically significant reduction in pulmonary virus titer, reduced associated inflammation in the lungs, and restricted extrapulmonary dissemination of the virus. Therapeutic doses of FLA3.14, FLA5.10, FLD20.19, and FLD21.140 provided robust protection from lethality at least up to 72 h postinfection with A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1). mAbs FLA3.14, FLD21.140 and FLD20.19, but not FLA5.10, were also therapeutically active in vivo against the Clade II virus A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1).

CONCLUSIONS:These studies provide proof of concept that fully human mAbs with neutralizing activity can be rapidly generated from the peripheral blood of convalescent patients and that these mAbs are effective for the prevention and treatment of H5N1 infection in a mouse model. A panel of neutralizing, cross-reactive mAbs might be useful for prophylaxis or adjunctive treatment of human cases of H5N1 influenza.},

The inflammatome signature significantly overlaps with known drug targets and co-expressed gene modules linked to metabolic disorders and cancer. A large proportion of genes in this signature are tightly connected in tissue-specific Bayesian networks (BNs) built from multiple independent mouse and human cohorts. Both the inflammatome signature and the corresponding consensus BNs are highly enriched for immune response-related genes supported as causal for adiposity, adipokine, diabetes, aortic lesion, bone, muscle, and cholesterol traits, suggesting the causal nature of the inflammatome for a variety of diseases. Integration of this inflammatome signature with the BNs uncovered 151 key drivers that appeared to be more biologically important than the non-drivers in terms of their impact on disease phenotypes. The identification of this inflammatome signature, its network architecture, and key drivers not only highlights the shared etiology but also pinpoints potential targets for intervention of various common diseases.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) and heterogeneous VISA (hVISA) phenotypes are increasingly reported in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains of distinct genetic backgrounds. This study tracked genetic evolution during the development of vancomycin non-susceptibility in a prevalent Asian community-associated MRSA clone of sequence type (ST) 59. METHODS: ST59 strains were consecutively isolated from a patient who failed chemotherapy for a septic knee over 15 months. The genetic mutations associated with the VISA phenotype were identified by whole-genome sequencing of two strains, which had the vancomycin-susceptible S. aureus (VSSA) and VISA phenotypes. The mutations were subsequently screened in other strains. By correlating the accumulated mutations with vancomycin susceptibility, genetic evolution was tracked at the whole-genome scale. RESULTS: Nine non-synonymous mutations and two steps of genetic evolution were identified during the development of the VISA phenotype. The first step involved a nonsense mutation in agrC and point mutations at five other loci, which were associated with the VSSA-to-hVISA conversion. Mutations of rpoB and fusA following the use of rifampicin and fusidic acid were identified in the second step of evolution, which corresponded to the development of dual resistance to rifampicin and fusidic acid and the conversion of hVISA to VISA. CONCLUSIONS: In vivo genetic evolution of S. aureus occurred in stepwise order during the development of incremental vancomycin non-susceptibility and was related to the use of antimicrobial agents.},

Vitek 2, a popular automated susceptibility testing method, was compared with Etest to assess its reliability on 150 Belgian P. aeruginonas isolates. Vitek 2 and Etest exhibited a high degree of concordance, but some discrepancies in clinical category were evident for cefepime (high minor and borderline very major error rate) and for piperacillin/tazobactam (high very major error rate). Vitek 2 appears to yield valuable information to the clinician concerning the antimicrobials amikacin, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and meropenem, in the setting of pseudomonas infection. For cefepime and piperacillin/tazobactam, a confirmatory testing by means of disk diffusion is worth considering.},

abstract = {Due to the limited information of the contribution of various antibiotic resistance mechanisms in clinical Burkholderia cepacia complex isolates, Antibiotic resistance mechanisms, including integron analysis, identification of quinolone resistance-determining region mutations, measurement of efflux pump activity, and sequence analysis of efflux pump regulators, were investigated in 66 clinical B. cepacia complex isolates. Species were identified via recA-RFLP and MALDI-TOF. Four genomovars were identified by recA-RFLP. B. cenocepacia (genomovar III) was the most prevalent genomovar (90.1{\%}). Most isolates (60/66, 90.9{\%}) were correctly identified by MALDI-TOF analysis. Clonal relatedness determined by PFGE analysis revealed 30 pulsotypes, including two major pulsotypes that comprised 22.7{\%} and 18.2{\%} of the isolates, respectively. Seventeen (25.8{\%}) isolates harboured class 1 integron with various combinations of resistance genes. Among six levofloxacin-resistant isolates, five had single-base substitutions in the gyrA gene and three demonstrated efflux pump activities. Among the 42 isolates exhibiting resistance to at least one antimicrobial agent, 94.4{\%} ceftazidime-resistant isolates (17/18) and 72.7{\%} chloramphenicol-resistant isolates (16/22) demonstrated efflux pump activity. Quantitation of efflux pump RNA level and sequence analysis revealed that over-expression of the RND-3 efflux pump was attributable to specific mutations in the RND-3 efflux pump regulator gene. In conclusion, high-level expression of efflux pumps is prevalent in B. cepacia complex isolates. Mutations in the RND-3 efflux pump regulator gene are the major cause of efflux pump activity, resulting in the resistance to antibiotics in clinical B. cepacia complex isolates.},

abstract = {Subtype-specific neuraminidase (NA) mutations conferring resistance to NA inhibitors (NAIs) have been reported during in vitro passages and in clinic. In this study, we evaluated the impact of various NA mutations (E119A/G/V, H274Y, R292K and N294S) on the susceptibility profiles to different NAIs (oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir) using recombinant NA proteins of influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Sydney/5/97-like (H3N2) viruses. In the Nl subtype, the E119V mutation conferred cross-resistance to oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir [1,727-2,144 and 5,050-fold increase in IC50 values compared with wild-type (WT)] whereas only oseltamivir-resistance (1,028-fold increase in IC50) was conferred by the same mutation in the N2 subtype. The N294S mutation conferred resistance to oseltamivir in both the NI and N2 subtypes (197- and 1,879-fold increase in IC50 values, respectively) whereas the H274Y mutation conferred resistance to oseltamivir (754-fold increase) and peramivir (260-fold increase) in the N1 subtype only. The virulence of reverse genetics-rescued A/WSN/33 viruses harbouring H274Y and N294S NA mutations was investigated in Balb/c mice. The WT and H274Y recombinants had identical LD50 values (103 PFUs) and generated similar viral lung titres, whereas a higher LD50 (10 PFUs) and a 1-log decrease in viral lung titres were obtained with the N294S mutant. This study shows that some NA mutations at framework residues may confer resistance to one or three NAIs depending on the viral subtype. It suggests that certain drug-resistant NA mutants may still be virulent although additional studies using clinical isolates are needed to confirm our results.},

abstract = {Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the leading cause of infectious diarrhoea in hospitalised patients. CDI increases patient healthcare costs due to extended hospitalisation, re-hospitalisation, laboratory tests and medications. However, the economic costs of CDI on healthcare systems remain uncertain. The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review to summarise available studies aimed at defining the economic healthcare costs of CDI. We conducted a literature search for peer-reviewed studies that investigated costs associated with CDI (1980 to present). Thirteen studies met inclusion and exclusion criteria. CDI costs in 2008 US dollars were calculated using the consumer price index. The total and incremental costs for primary and recurrent CDI were estimated. Of the 13, 10 were from the USA and one each from Canada, UK, and Ireland. In US-based studies incremental cost estimates ranged from {\$}2,871 to {\$}4,846 per case for primary CDI and from {\$}13,655 to {\$}18,067 per case for recurrent CDI. US-based studies in special populations (subjects with irritable bowel disease, surgical inpatients, and patients treated in the intensive care unit) showed an incremental cost range from {\$}6,242 to {\$}90,664. Non-US-based studies showed an estimated incremental cost of {\$}5,243 to {\$}8,570 per case for primary CDI and {\$}13,655 per case for recurrent CDI. Economic healthcare costs of CDI were high for primary and recurrent cases. The high cost associated with CDI justifies the use of additional resources for CDI prevention and control. ?? 2009 The Hospital Infection Society.},

abstract = {An IFN-gamma-inducible protein, IP-10, has previously been described to belong to a gene family of chemotactic and mitogenic proteins, associated with inflammation and proliferation. Biochemical characterization of this predicted protein has been pursued through the development of polyclonal monospecific antisera to recombinant protein and synthetic peptides. These reagents establish that the IP-10 protein is secreted from a variety of cells (endothelial, monocyte, fibroblast, and keratinocyte) in response to IFN-gamma. Posttranslational processing occurs in the biosynthesis of this protein, resulting in a 6-7-kD species, which may reflect COOH-terminal cleavage. Pulse-chase studies indicate that this processing is a rapid event in the primary cell lines studied, completed in the 30-min labeling period. A model is presented for the processing and secondary structure of this protein. In an accompanying study, Kaplan, et al. using these antisera, demonstrate that the IP-10 protein is associated, in vivo, with a delayed-type hypersensitivity response.},

More than 100,000 individuals have been genotyped by direct-to-consumer genetic testing services, which offer a glimpse into the interpretation and exploration of a personal genome. However, these interpretations, which require extensive manual curation, are subject to the preferences of the company and are not customizable by the individual. Academic institutions teaching personalized medicine, as well as genetic hobbyists, may prefer to customize their analysis and have full control over the content and method of interpretation. We present the Interpretome, a system for private genome interpretation, which contains all genotype information in client-side interpretation scripts, supported by server-side databases. We provide state-of-the-art analyses for teaching clinical implications of personal genomics, including disease risk assessment and pharmacogenomics. Additionally, we have implemented client-side algorithms for ancestry inference, demonstrating the power of these methods without excessive computation. Finally, the modular nature of the system allows for plugin capabilities for custom analyses. This system will allow for personal genome exploration without compromising privacy, facilitating hands-on courses in genomics and personalized medicine.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Long-lasting relapsing or lingering rheumatic musculoskeletal pain (RMSP) is the hallmark of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) rheumatism (CHIK-R). Little is known on their prognostic factors. The aim of this prognostic study was to search the determinants of lingering or relapsing RMSP indicative of CHIK-R. METHODS: Three hundred and forty-six infected adults (age ≥ 15 years) having declared RMSP at disease onset were extracted from the TELECHIK cohort study, Reunion island, and analyzed using a multinomial logistic regression model. We also searched for the predictors of CHIKV-specific IgG titres, assessed at the time of a serosurvey, using multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Of these, 111 (32.1{\%}) reported relapsing RMSP, 150 (43.3{\%}) lingering RMSP, and 85 (24.6{\%}) had fully recovered (reference group) on average two years after acute infection. In the final model controlling for gender, the determinants of relapsing RMSP were the age 45-59 years (adjusted OR: 2.9, 95{\%} CI: 1.0, 8.6) or greater or equal than 60 years (adjusted OR: 10.4, 95{\%} CI: 3.5, 31.1), severe rheumatic involvement (fever, at least six joints plus four other symptoms) at presentation (adjusted OR: 3.6, 95{\%} CI: 1.5, 8.2), and CHIKV-specific IgG titres (adjusted OR: 3.2, 95{\%} CI: 1.8, 5.5, per one unit increase). Prognostic factors for lingering RMSP were age 45-59 years (adjusted OR: 6.4, 95{\%} CI: 1.8, 22.1) or greater or equal than 60 years (adjusted OR: 22.3, 95{\%} CI: 6.3, 78.1), severe initial rheumatic involvement (adjusted OR: 5.5, 95{\%} CI: 2.2, 13.8) and CHIKV-specific IgG titres (adjusted OR: 6.2, 95{\%} CI: 2.8, 13.2, per one unit increase). CHIKV specific IgG titres were positively correlated with age, female gender and the severity of initial rheumatic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the roles of age, severity at presentation and CHIKV specific IgG titres for predicting CHIK-R. By identifying the prognostic value of the humoral immune response of the host, this work also suggest a significant contribution of the adaptive immune response to the physiopathology of CHIK-R and should help to reconsider the paradigm of this chronic infection primarily shifted towards the involvement of the innate immune response.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Multiple cases of transmission of avian H5N1 influenza viruses to humans illustrate the urgent need for an efficacious, cross-protective vaccine.

METHODS:Ferrets were immunized with inactivated whole-virus vaccine produced by reverse genetics with the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase genes of A/HK/213/03 virus. Ferrets received a single dose of vaccine (7 or 15 microg of HA) with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant or 2 doses (7 microg of HA each) without adjuvant and were challenged with 10(6) 50{\%} egg infectious doses of A/HK/213/03, A/HK/156/97, or A/Vietnam/1203/04 virus.

RESULTS:One or 2 doses of vaccine induced a protective antibody response to the vaccine strain. All immunization regimens completely protected ferrets from challenge with homologous wild-type A/HK/213/03 virus: no clinical signs of infection were observed, virus replication was significantly reduced (P{\textless}.05) and was restricted to the upper respiratory tract, and spread of virus to the brain was prevented. Importantly, all vaccinated ferrets were protected against lethal challenge with the highly pathogenic strain A/Vietnam/1203/04. The 2-dose schedule induced higher levels of antibodies that were cross-reactive to antigenically distinct H5N1 viruses.

CONCLUSIONS:H5N1 vaccines may stimulate an immune response that is more cross-protective than what might be predicted by in vitro assays and, thus, hold potential for being stockpiled as "initial" pandemic vaccines.},

To address this problem, we demonstrate that the MinHash technique, first applied to clustering web pages, can be applied to biological sequences with similar effect, and extend this idea to include biologically relevant distance and significance measures. Our new tool, Mash, uses MinHash locality-sensitive hashing to reduce large sequences to a representative sketch and rapidly estimate pairwise distances between genomes or metagenomes. Using Mash, we explored several use cases, including a 5,000-fold size reduction and clustering of all {\~{}}55,000 NCBI RefSeq genomes in 46 CPU hours. The resulting 93 MB sketch database includes all RefSeq genomes, effectively delineates known species boundaries, reconstructs approximate phylogenies, and can be searched in seconds using assembled genomes or raw sequencing runs from Illumina, Pacific Biosciences, and Oxford Nanopore. For metagenomics, Mash scales to thousands of samples and can replicate Human Microbiome Project and Global Ocean Survey results in a fraction of the time. Other potential applications include any problem where an approximate, global sequence distance is acceptable, e.g. to triage and cluster sequence data, assign species labels to unknown genomes, quickly identify mistracked samples, and search massive genomic databases. In addition, the Mash distance metric is based on simple set intersections, which are compatible with homomorphic encryption schemes. To facilitate integration with other software, Mash is implemented as a lightweight C++ toolkit and freely released under a BSD license at https://github.com/marbl/mash.},

abstract = {Dengue is a pantropic public health problem. In children, dengue shock syndrome (DSS) is the most common life-threatening complication. The ability to predict which patients may develop DSS may improve triage and treatment. To this end, we conducted a nested case-control comparison of the early host transcriptional features in 24 DSS patients and 56 sex-, age-, and virus serotype-matched uncomplicated (UC) dengue patients. In the first instance, we defined the "early dengue" profile. The transcriptional signature in acute rather than convalescent samples (≤72 h post-illness onset) was defined by an overabundance of interferon-inducible transcripts (31{\%} of the 551 overabundant transcripts) and canonical gene ontology terms that included the following: response to virus, immune response, innate immune response, and inflammatory response. Pathway and network analyses identified STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, IRF7, IRF9, IRF1, CEBPB, and SP1 as key transcriptional factors mediating the early response. Strikingly, the only difference in the transcriptional signatures of early DSS and UC dengue cases was the greater abundance of several neutrophil-associated transcripts in patients who progressed to DSS, a finding supported by higher plasma concentrations of several canonical proteins associated with neutrophil degranulation (bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein [BPI], elastase 2 [ELA2], and defensin 1 alpha [DEF1A]). Elevated levels of neutrophil-associated transcripts were independent of the neutrophil count and also of the genotype of the infecting virus, as genome-length sequences of dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1) (n = 15) and DENV-2 (n = 3) sampled from DSS patients were phylogenetically indistinguishable from those sampled from uncomplicated dengue patients (32 DENV-1 and 9 DENV-2 sequences). Collectively, these data suggest a hitherto unrecognized association between neutrophil activation, pathogenesis, and the development of DSS and point to future strategies for guiding prognosis.},

abstract = {Comparisons of proteins show that they evolve through the movement of domains. However, in many cases, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we observed the movements of DNA recognition domains between non-orthologous proteins within a prokaryote genome. Restriction-modification (RM) systems, consisting of a sequence-specific DNA methyltransferase and a restriction enzyme, contribute to maintenance/evolution of genomes/epigenomes. RM systems limit horizontal gene transfer but are themselves mobile. We compared Type III RM systems in Helicobacter pylori genomes and found that target recognition domain (TRD) sequences are mobile, moving between different orthologous groups that occupy unique chromosomal locations. Sequence comparisons suggested that a likely underlying mechanism is movement through homologous recombination of similar DNA sequences that encode amino acid sequence motifs that are conserved among Type III DNA methyltransferases. Consistent with this movement, incongruence was observed between the phylogenetic trees of TRD regions and other regions in proteins. Horizontal acquisition of diverse TRD sequences was suggested by detection of homologs in other Helicobacter species and distantly related bacterial species. One of these RM systems in H. pylori was inactivated by insertion of another RM system that likely transferred from an oral bacterium. TRD movement represents a novel route for diversification of DNA-interacting proteins.},

abstract = {We use insurance claims data for 27.6 percent of individuals with private employer-sponsored insurance in the US between 2007 and 2011 to examine the variation in health spending and in hospitals' transaction prices. We document the variation in hospital prices within and across geographic areas, examine how hospital prices influence the variation in health spending on the privately insured, and analyze the factors associated with hospital price variation. Four key findings emerge. First, health care spending per privately insured beneficiary varies by a factor of three across the 306 Hospital Referral Regions (HRRs) in the US. Moreover, the correlation between total spending per privately insured beneficiary and total spending per Medicare beneficiary across HRRs is only 0.14. Second, variation in providers' transaction prices across HRRs is the primary driver of spending variation for the privately insured, whereas variation in the quantity of care provided across HRRs is the primary driver of Medicare spending variation. Consequently, extrapolating lessons on health spending from Medicare to the privately insured must be done with caution. Third, we document large dispersion in overall inpatient hospital prices and in prices for seven relatively homogenous procedures. For example, hospital prices for lower-limb MRIs vary by a factor of twelve across the nation and, on average, two-fold within HRRs. Finally, hospital prices are positively associated with indicators of hospital market power. Even after conditioning on many demand and cost factors, hospital prices in monopoly markets are 15.3 percent higher than those in markets with four or more hospitals.},

abstract = {Genetic variation is critical in microbial immune evasion and drug resistance, but variation has rarely been studied in complex heterogeneous communities such as the human microbiome. To begin to study natural variation, we analyzed DNA viruses present in the lower gastrointestinal tract of 12 human volunteers by determining 48 billion bases of viral DNA sequence. Viral genomes mostly showed low variation, but 51 loci of ∼100 bp showed extremely high variation, so that up to 96{\%} of the viral genomes encoded unique amino acid sequences. Some hotspots of hypervariation were in genes homologous to the bacteriophage BPP-1 viral tail-fiber gene, which is known to be hypermutagenized by a unique reverse-transcriptase (RT)-based mechanism. Unexpectedly, other hypervariable loci in our data were in previously undescribed gene types, including genes encoding predicted Ig-superfamily proteins. Most of the hypervariable loci were linked to genes encoding RTs of a single clade, which we find is the most abundant clade among gut viruses but only a minor component of bacterial RT populations. Hypervariation was targeted to 5'-AAY-3' asparagine codons, which allows maximal chemical diversification of the encoded amino acids while avoiding formation of stop codons. These findings document widespread targeted hypervariation in the human gut virome, identify previously undescribed types of genes targeted for hypervariation, clarify association with RT gene clades, and motivate studies of hypervariation in the full human microbiome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vertebrate immune systems generate diverse repertoires of antibodies capable of mediating response to a variety of antigens. Next generation sequencing methods provide unique approaches to a number of immuno-based research areas including antibody discovery and engineering, disease surveillance, and host immune response to vaccines. In particular, single-molecule circular consensus sequencing permits the sequencing of antibody repertoires at previously unattainable depths of coverage and accuracy. We approached the bovine immunoglobulin G (IgG) repertoire with the objective of characterizing diversity of expressed IgG transcripts. Here we present single-molecule real-time sequencing data of expressed IgG heavy-chain repertoires of four individual cattle. We describe the diversity observed within antigen binding regions and visualize this diversity using a network-based approach.

RESULTS: We generated 49,945 high quality cDNA sequences, each spanning the entire IgG variable region from four Bos taurus calves. From these sequences we identified 49,521 antigen binding regions using the automated Paratome web server. Approximately 9{\%} of all unique complementarity determining 2 (CDR2) sequences were of variable lengths. A bimodal distribution of unique CDR3 sequence lengths was observed, with common lengths of 5-6 and 21-25 amino acids. The average number of cysteine residues in CDR3s increased with CDR3 length and we observed that cysteine residues were centrally located in CDR3s. We identified 19 extremely long CDR3 sequences (up to 62 amino acids in length) within IgG transcripts. Network analyses revealed distinct patterns among the expressed IgG antigen binding repertoires of the examined individuals.

CONCLUSIONS: We utilized circular consensus sequencing technology to provide baseline data of the expressed bovine IgG repertoire that can be used for future studies important to livestock research. Somatic mutation resulting in base insertions and deletions in CDR2 further diversifies the bovine antibody repertoire. In contrast to previous studies, our data indicate that unusually long CDR3 sequences are not unique to IgM antibodies in cattle. Centrally located cysteine residues in bovine CDR3s provide further evidence that disulfide bond formation is likely of structural importance. We hypothesize that network or cluster-based analyses of expressed antibody repertoires from controlled challenge experiments will help identify novel natural antigen binding solutions to specific pathogens of interest.},

Class 1 integrons were clearly associated with multidrug resistance. Sequencing data revealed that aminoglycoside-modifying genes occurred most frequently in the integron and disclosed a new blaIMP-8/aac6-II/aadA5 gene cassette. Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to assess the expression of Sme efflux pumps and SpgM in S. maltophilia. MDR isolates exhibited hyperexpression of SmeABC, and SmeDEF and SpgM were more frequently found in MDR isolates than non-MDR isolates. In addition, the ability of MDR isolates to form melanin-like pigment and biofilm was also greater than that of the non-MDR isolates. The SmeABC or SmeDEF pump was shown to be associated with resistance to all agents tested. The presence of an integron as well as production of pigment and biofilm was also responsible for resistance against eight, six and six of the tested agents, respectively. High SpgM expression was associated with resistance to only three of the tested agents. These findings define the important roles of integrons, efflux pumps, and melanin-like pigment and biofilm formation in the multidrug resistance of S. maltophilia. MDR isolates possessed more resistance mechanisms than susceptible strains. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. and the International Society of Chemotherapy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Clinical laboratory tests are now being prescribed and made directly available to consumers through retail outlets in the USA. Concerns with these test have been raised regarding the uncertainty of testing methods used in these venues and a lack of open, scientific validation of the technical accuracy and clinical equivalency of results obtained through these services. METHODS We conducted a cohort study of 60 healthy adults to compare the uncertainty and accuracy in 22 common clinical lab tests between one company offering blood tests obtained from finger prick (Theranos) and 2 major clinical testing services that require standard venipuncture draws (Quest and LabCorp). Samples were collected in Phoenix, Arizona, at an ambulatory clinic and at retail outlets with point-of-care services. RESULTS Theranos flagged tests outside their normal range 1.6× more often than other testing services (P {\textless} 0.0001). Of the 22 lab measurements evaluated, 15 (68{\%}) showed significant interservice variability (P {\textless} 0.002). We found nonequivalent lipid panel test results between Theranos and other clinical services. Variability in testing services, sample collection times, and subjects markedly influenced lab results. CONCLUSION While laboratory practice standards exist to control this variability, the disparities between testing services we observed could potentially alter clinical interpretation and health care utilization. Greater transparency and evaluation of testing technologies would increase their utility in personalized health management.

@article{Haynes2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Computerized clinical decision support systems are information technology-based systems designed to improve clinical decision-making. As with any healthcare intervention with claims to improve process of care or patient outcomes, decision support systems should be rigorously evaluated before widespread dissemination into clinical practice. Engaging healthcare providers and managers in the review process may facilitate knowledge translation and uptake. The objective of this research was to form a partnership of healthcare providers, managers, and researchers to review randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of computerized decision support for six clinical application areas: primary preventive care, therapeutic drug monitoring and dosing, drug prescribing, chronic disease management, diagnostic test ordering and interpretation, and acute care management; and to identify study characteristics that predict benefit.

METHODS: The review was undertaken by the Health Information Research Unit, McMaster University, in partnership with Hamilton Health Sciences, the Hamilton, Niagara, Haldimand, and Brant Local Health Integration Network, and pertinent healthcare service teams. Following agreement on information needs and interests with decision-makers, our earlier systematic review was updated by searching Medline, EMBASE, EBM Review databases, and Inspec, and reviewing reference lists through 6 January 2010. Data extraction items were expanded according to input from decision-makers. Authors of primary studies were contacted to confirm data and to provide additional information. Eligible trials were organized according to clinical area of application. We included randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effect on practitioner performance or patient outcomes of patient care provided with a computerized clinical decision support system compared with patient care without such a system.

RESULTS: Data will be summarized using descriptive summary measures, including proportions for categorical variables and means for continuous variables. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models will be used to investigate associations between outcomes of interest and study specific covariates. When reporting results from individual studies, we will cite the measures of association and p-values reported in the studies. If appropriate for groups of studies with similar features, we will conduct meta-analyses.

CONCLUSION: A decision-maker-researcher partnership provides a model for systematic reviews that may foster knowledge translation and uptake.},

abstract = {Patients with resected stage II-III cutaneous melanomas remain at high risk for metastasis and death. Biomarker development has been limited by the challenge of isolating high-quality RNA for transcriptome-wide profiling from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary tumor specimens. Using NanoString technology, RNA from 40 stage II-III FFPE primary melanomas was analyzed and a 53-immune-gene panel predictive of non-progression (area under the curve (AUC)=0.920) was defined. The signature predicted disease-specific survival (DSS P{\textless}0.001) and recurrence-free survival (RFS P{\textless}0.001). CD2, the most differentially expressed gene in the training set, also predicted non-progression (P{\textless}0.001). Using publicly available microarray data from 46 primary human melanomas (GSE15605), a coexpression module enriched for the 53-gene panel was then identified using unbiased methods. A Bayesian network of signaling pathways based on this data identified driver genes. Finally, the proposed 53-gene panel was confirmed in an independent test population of 48 patients (AUC=0.787). The gene signature was an independent predictor of non-progression (P{\textless}0.001), RFS (P{\textless}0.001), and DSS (P=0.024) in the test population. The identified driver genes are potential therapeutic targets, and the 53-gene panel should be tested for clinical application using a larger data set annotated on the basis of prospectively gathered data.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little is known about the immunopathogenesis of Chikungunya virus. Circulating levels of immune mediators and growth factors were analyzed from patients infected during the first Singaporean Chikungunya fever outbreak in early 2008 to establish biomarkers associated with infection and/or disease severity.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: Adult patients with laboratory-confirmed Chikungunya fever infection, who were referred to the Communicable Disease Centre/Tan Tock Seng Hospital during the period from January to February 2008, were included in this retrospective study. Plasma fractions were analyzed using a multiplex-microbead immunoassay. Among the patients, the most common clinical features were fever (100{\%}), arthralgia (90{\%}), rash (50{\%}) and conjunctivitis (40{\%}). Profiles of 30 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were able to discriminate the clinical forms of Chikungunya from healthy controls, with patients classified as non-severe and severe disease. Levels of 8 plasma cytokines and 4 growth factors were significantly elevated. Statistical analysis showed that an increase in IL-1beta, IL-6 and a decrease in RANTES were associated with disease severity.

CONCLUSIONS: This is the first comprehensive report on the production of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors during acute Chikungunya virus infection. Using these biomarkers, we were able to distinguish between mild disease and more severe forms of Chikungunya fever, thus enabling the identification of patients with poor prognosis and monitoring of the disease.},

abstract = {The clinical course of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is heterogeneous. Several prognostic factors have been identified that can stratify patients into groups that differ in their relative tendency for disease progression and/or survival. Here, we pursued a subnetwork-based analysis of gene expression profiles to discriminate between groups of patients with disparate risks for CLL progression. From an initial cohort of 130 patients, we identified 38 prognostic subnetworks that could predict the relative risk for disease progression requiring therapy from the time of sample collection, more accurately than established markers. The prognostic power of these subnetworks then was validated on 2 other cohorts of patients. We noted reduced divergence in gene expression between leukemia cells of CLL patients classified at diagnosis with aggressive versus indolent disease over time. The predictive subnetworks vary in levels of expression over time but exhibit increased similarity at later time points before therapy, suggesting that degenerate pathways apparently converge into common pathways that are associated with disease progression. As such, these results have implications for understanding cancer evolution and for the development of novel treatment strategies for patients with CLL.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The first identified cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection in humans occurred in China during February and March 2013. We analyzed data obtained from field investigations to describe the epidemiologic characteristics of H7N9 cases in China identified as of December 1, 2013.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Field investigations were conducted for each confirmed case of H7N9 virus infection. A patient was considered to have a confirmed case if the presence of the H7N9 virus was verified by means of real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay (RT-PCR), viral isolation, or serologic testing. Information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines was obtained from patients with confirmed cases. Close contacts were monitored for 7 days for symptoms of illness. Throat swabs were obtained from contacts in whom symptoms developed and were tested for the presence of the H7N9 virus by means of real-time RT-PCR.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Among 139 persons with confirmed H7N9 virus infection, the median age was 61 years (range, 2 to 91), 71{\%} were male, and 73{\%} were urban residents. Confirmed cases occurred in 12 areas of China. Nine persons were poultry workers, and of 131 persons with available data, 82{\%} had a history of exposure to live animals, including chickens (82{\%}). A total of 137 persons (99{\%}) were hospitalized, 125 (90{\%}) had pneumonia or respiratory failure, and 65 of 103 with available data (63{\%}) were admitted to an intensive care unit. A total of 47 persons (34{\%}) died in the hospital after a median duration of illness of 21 days, 88 were discharged from the hospital, and 2 remain hospitalized in critical condition; 2 patients were not admitted to a hospital. In four family clusters, human-to-human transmission of H7N9 virus could not be ruled out. Excluding secondary cases in clusters, 2675 close contacts of case patients completed the monitoring period; respiratory symptoms developed in 28 of them (1{\%}); all tested negative for H7N9 virus.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Most persons with confirmed H7N9 virus infection had severe lower respiratory tract illness, were epidemiologically unrelated, and had a history of recent exposure to poultry. However, limited, nonsustained human-to-human H7N9 virus transmission could not be ruled out in four families.},

abstract = {Importance Deep learning is a family of computational methods that allow an algorithm to program itself by learning from a large set of examples that demonstrate the desired behavior, removing the need to specify rules explicitly. Application of these methods to medical imaging requires further assessment and validation. Objective To apply deep learning to create an algorithm for automated detection of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema in retinal fundus photographs. Design and Setting A specific type of neural network optimized for image classification called a deep convolutional neural network was trained using a retrospective development data set of 128 175 retinal images, which were graded 3 to 7 times for diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and image gradability by a panel of 54 US licensed ophthalmologists and ophthalmology senior residents between May and December 2015. The resultant algorithm was validated in January and February 2016 using 2 separate data sets, both graded by at least 7 US board-certified ophthalmologists with high intragrader consistency. Exposure Deep learning-trained algorithm. Main Outcomes and Measures The sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR), defined as moderate and worse diabetic retinopathy, referable diabetic macular edema, or both, were generated based on the reference standard of the majority decision of the ophthalmologist panel. The algorithm was evaluated at 2 operating points selected from the development set, one selected for high specificity and another for high sensitivity. Results The EyePACS-1 data set consisted of 9963 images from 4997 patients (mean age, 54.4 years; 62.2{\%} women; prevalence of RDR, 683/8878 fully gradable images [7.8{\%}]); the Messidor-2 data set had 1748 images from 874 patients (mean age, 57.6 years; 42.6{\%} women; prevalence of RDR, 254/1745 fully gradable images [14.6{\%}]). For detecting RDR, the algorithm had an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.991 (95{\%} CI, 0.988-0.993) for EyePACS-1 and 0.990 (95{\%} CI, 0.986-0.995) for Messidor-2. Using the first operating cut point with high specificity, for EyePACS-1, the sensitivity was 90.3{\%} (95{\%} CI, 87.5{\%}-92.7{\%}) and the specificity was 98.1{\%} (95{\%} CI, 97.8{\%}-98.5{\%}). For Messidor-2, the sensitivity was 87.0{\%} (95{\%} CI, 81.1{\%}-91.0{\%}) and the specificity was 98.5{\%} (95{\%} CI, 97.7{\%}-99.1{\%}). Using a second operating point with high sensitivity in the development set, for EyePACS-1 the sensitivity was 97.5{\%} and specificity was 93.4{\%} and for Messidor-2 the sensitivity was 96.1{\%} and specificity was 93.9{\%}. Conclusions and Relevance In this evaluation of retinal fundus photographs from adults with diabetes, an algorithm based on deep machine learning had high sensitivity and specificity for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy. Further research is necessary to determine the feasibility of applying this algorithm in the clinical setting and to determine whether use of the algorithm could lead to improved care and outcomes compared with current ophthalmologic assessment.},

abstract = {Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) could potentially provide a single platform for extracting all the information required to predict an organism's phenotype. However, its ability to provide accurate predictions has not yet been demonstrated in large independent studies of specific organisms. In this study, we aimed to develop a genotypic prediction method for antimicrobial susceptibilities. The whole genomes of 501 unrelated Staphylococcus aureus isolates were sequenced, and the assembled genomes were interrogated using BLASTn for a panel of known resistance determinants (chromosomal mutations and genes carried on plasmids). Results were compared with phenotypic susceptibility testing for 12 commonly used antimicrobial agents (penicillin, methicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, trimethoprim, gentamicin, fusidic acid, rifampin, and mupirocin) performed by the routine clinical laboratory. We investigated discrepancies by repeat susceptibility testing and manual inspection of the sequences and used this information to optimize the resistance determinant panel and BLASTn algorithm. We then tested performance of the optimized tool in an independent validation set of 491 unrelated isolates, with phenotypic results obtained in duplicate by automated broth dilution (BD Phoenix) and disc diffusion. In the validation set, the overall sensitivity and specificity of the genomic prediction method were 0.97 (95{\%} confidence interval [95{\%} CI], 0.95 to 0.98) and 0.99 (95{\%} CI, 0.99 to 1), respectively, compared to standard susceptibility testing methods. The very major error rate was 0.5{\%}, and the major error rate was 0.7{\%}. WGS was as sensitive and specific as routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods. WGS is a promising alternative to culture methods for resistance prediction in S. aureus and ultimately other major bacterial pathogens.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing technologies are currently revolutionizing the field of biology and medicine, yet bioinformatic challenges in analysing very large data sets have slowed the adoption of these technologies by the community of population biologists. We introduce the 'Simple Fool's Guide to Population Genomics via RNA-seq' (SFG), a document intended to serve as an easy-to-follow protocol, walking a user through one example of high-throughput sequencing data analysis of nonmodel organisms. It is by no means an exhaustive protocol, but rather serves as an introduction to the bioinformatic methods used in population genomics, enabling a user to gain familiarity with basic analysis steps. The SFG consists of two parts. This document summarizes the steps needed and lays out the basic themes for each and a simple approach to follow. The second document is the full SFG, publicly available at http://sfg.stanford.edu, that includes detailed protocols for data processing and analysis, along with a repository of custom-made scripts and sample files. Steps included in the SFG range from tissue collection to de novo assembly, blast annotation, alignment, gene expression, functional enrichment, SNP detection, principal components and F(ST) outlier analyses. Although the technical aspects of population genomics are changing very quickly, our hope is that this document will help population biologists with little to no background in high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to more quickly adopt these new techniques.},

abstract = {While searching for alternative reading-frame peptides encoded by influenza A virus that are recognized by CD8+ T cells, we found an abundant immunogenic peptide encoded by the +1 reading frame of PB1. This peptide derives from a novel conserved 87-residue protein, PB1-F2, which has several unusual features compared with other influenza gene products in addition to its mode of translation. These include its absence from some animal (particularly swine) influenza virus isolates, variable expression in individual infected cells, rapid proteasome-dependent degradation and mitochondrial localization. Exposure of cells to a synthetic version of PB1-F2 induces apoptosis, and influenza viruses with targeted mutations that interfere with PB1-F2 expression induce less extensive apoptosis in human monocytic cells than those with intact PB1-F2. We propose that PB1-F2 functions to kill host immune cells responding to influenza virus infection.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: We have developed a software package, Cortex, designed for the analysis of genetic variation by de novo assembly of multiple samples. This allows direct comparison of samples without using a reference genome as intermediate and incorporates discovery and genotyping of single-nucleotide polymorphisms, indels and larger events in a single framework. We introduce pipelines which simplify the analysis of microbial samples and increase discovery power; these also enable the construction of a graph of known sequence and variation in a species, against which new samples can be compared rapidly. We demonstrate the ease-of-use and power by reproducing the results of studies using both long and short reads.

abstract = {The lion's share of bacteria in various environments cannot be cloned in the laboratory and thus cannot be sequenced using existing technologies. A major goal of single-cell genomics is to complement gene-centric metagenomic data with whole-genome assemblies of uncultivated organisms. Assembly of single-cell data is challenging because of highly non-uniform read coverage as well as elevated levels of sequencing errors and chimeric reads. We describe SPAdes, a new assembler for both single-cell and standard (multicell) assembly, and demonstrate that it improves on the recently released E+V-SC assembler (specialized for single-cell data) and on popular assemblers Velvet and SoapDeNovo (for multicell data). SPAdes generates single-cell assemblies, providing information about genomes of uncultivatable bacteria that vastly exceeds what may be obtained via traditional metagenomics studies. SPAdes is available online ( http://bioinf.spbau.ru/spades ). It is distributed as open source software.},

abstract = {Background: Patients born outside the UK have contributed to a 20{\%} rise in the UK's tuberculosis incidence since 2000, but their effect on domestic transmission is not known. Here we use whole-genome sequencing to investigate the epidemiology of tuberculosis transmission in an unselected population over 6 years. Methods: We identified all residents with Oxfordshire postcodes with a Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture or a clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis between Jan 1, 2007, and Dec 31, 2012, using local databases and checking against the national Enhanced Tuberculosis Surveillance database. We used Illumina technology to sequence all available M tuberculosis cultures from identified cases. Sequences were clustered by genetic relatedness and compared retrospectively with contact investigations. The first patient diagnosed in each cluster was defined as the index case, with links to subsequent cases assigned first by use of any epidemiological linkage, then by genetic distance, and then by timing of diagnosis. Findings: Although we identified 384 patients with a diagnosis of tuberculosis, country of birth was known for 380 and we sequenced isolates from 247 of 269 cases with culture-confirmed disease. 39 cases were genomically linked within 13 clusters, implying 26 local transmission events. Only 11 of 26 possible transmissions had been previously identified through contact tracing. Of seven genomically confirmed household clusters, five contained additional genomic links to epidemiologically unidentified non-household members. 255 (67{\%}) patients were born in a country with high tuberculosis incidence, conferring a local incidence of 109 cases per 100000 population per year in Oxfordshire, compared with 3{\textperiodcentered}5 cases per 100000 per year for those born in low-incidence countries. However, patients born in the low-incidence countries, predominantly UK, were more likely to have pulmonary disease (adjusted odds ratio 1{\textperiodcentered}8 [95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}2-2{\textperiodcentered}9]; p=0{\textperiodcentered}009), social risk factors (4{\textperiodcentered}4 [2{\textperiodcentered}0-9{\textperiodcentered}4]; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), and be part of a local transmission cluster (4{\textperiodcentered}8 [1{\textperiodcentered}6-14{\textperiodcentered}8]; p=0{\textperiodcentered}006). Interpretation: Although inward migration has contributed to the overall tuberculosis incidence, our findings suggest that most patients born in high-incidence countries reactivate latent infection acquired abroad and are not involved in local onward transmission. Systematic screening of new entrants could further improve tuberculosis control, but it is important that health care remains accessible to all individuals, especially high-risk groups, if tuberculosis control is not to be jeopardised.

abstract = {Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has caused large outbreaks worldwide in recent years. Acute-phase CHIKV infection has been reported to cause mild to severe febrile illness, and in some patients, this may be followed by long-lasting polyarthritis. The mainstay of treatment includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and other disease-modifying agents, the use of which is based on the assumption of an immunological interference mechanism in the pathogenesis. The present study has been designed to generate preliminary evidence to test this hypothesis. The levels of 30 cytokines were estimated in serum samples of acute CHIKV-infected patients, fully-recovered patients, patients with chronic CHIKV arthritis, and controls, using a quantitative multiplex bead ELISA. The levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-6 were elevated in acute patients, but IFN-$\gamma$/$\beta$ and TNF-$\alpha$ levels remained stable. IL-10, which might have an anti-inflammatory effect, was also elevated, indicating a predominantly anti-inflammatory response in the acute phase of infection. Elevation of MCP-1, IL-6, IL-8, MIP-1$\alpha$, and MIP-1$\beta$ was most prominent in the chronic phase. These cytokines and chemokines have been shown to play important roles in other arthritides, including epidemic polyarthritis (EPA) caused by Ross River virus (RRV) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).The immunopathogenesis of chronic CHIKV arthritis might have similarities to these arthritides. The novel intervention strategies being developed for EPA and RA, such as IL-6 and IL-8 signaling blockade, may also be considered for chronic CHIKV arthritis.},

Here, we demonstrate that WGS performed prospectively for national epidemiologic surveillance of Listeria monocytogenes has the capacity to be superior to our current approach using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), binary typing and serotyping. Initially 423 L. monocytogenes isolates underwent WGS and comparisons uncovered a diverse genetic population structure derived from three distinct lineages. MLST, binary and serotyping results inferred in silico from the WGS data were highly concordant ({\textgreater}99{\%}) with laboratory typing performed in parallel. However, WGS was able to identify distinct nested clusters within groups of isolates that were otherwise indistinguishable by our current typing methods. Routine WGS was then used for prospective epidemiologic surveillance on a further 97 L. monocytogenes isolates over a 12-month period, providing a greater level of discrimination to conventional typing for inferring linkage to point source outbreaks. A risk based alert system based on WGS similarity was used to inform epidemiologists required to act on the data. Our experience shows WGS could be adopted for prospective L. monocytogenes surveillance, and investigated for other pathogens relevant to public health.},

abstract = {RNA-seq may replace gene expression microarrays in the near future. Using RNA-seq, the expression of a gene can be estimated using the total number of sequence reads mapped to that gene, known as the total read count (TReC). Traditional expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping methods, such as linear regression, can be applied to TReC measurements after they are properly normalized. In this article, we show that eQTL mapping, by directly modeling TReC using discrete distributions, has higher statistical power than the two-step approach: data normalization followed by linear regression. In addition, RNA-seq provides information on allele-specific expression (ASE) that is not available from microarrays. By combining the information from TReC and ASE, we can computationally distinguish cis- and trans-eQTL and further improve the power of cis-eQTL mapping. Both simulation and real data studies confirm the improved power of our new methods. We also discuss the design issues of RNA-seq experiments. Specifically, we show that by combining TReC and ASE measurements, it is possible to minimize cost and retain the statistical power of cis-eQTL mapping by reducing sample size while increasing the number of sequence reads per sample. In addition to RNA-seq data, our method can also be employed to study the genetic basis of other types of sequencing data, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA sequencing data. In this article, we focus on eQTL mapping of a single gene using the association-based method. However, our method establishes a statistical framework for future developments of eQTL mapping methods using RNA-seq data (e.g., linkage-based eQTL mapping), and the joint study of multiple genetic markers and/or multiple genes.},

@article{Bader2003a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent advances in proteomics technologies such as two-hybrid, phage display and mass spectrometry have enabled us to create a detailed map of biomolecular interaction networks. Initial mapping efforts have already produced a wealth of data. As the size of the interaction set increases, databases and computational methods will be required to store, visualize and analyze the information in order to effectively aid in knowledge discovery. RESULTS: This paper describes a novel graph theoretic clustering algorithm, "Molecular Complex Detection" (MCODE), that detects densely connected regions in large protein-protein interaction networks that may represent molecular complexes. The method is based on vertex weighting by local neighborhood density and outward traversal from a locally dense seed protein to isolate the dense regions according to given parameters. The algorithm has the advantage over other graph clustering methods of having a directed mode that allows fine-tuning of clusters of interest without considering the rest of the network and allows examination of cluster interconnectivity, which is relevant for protein networks. Protein interaction and complex information from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used for evaluation. CONCLUSION: Dense regions of protein interaction networks can be found, based solely on connectivity data, many of which correspond to known protein complexes. The algorithm is not affected by a known high rate of false positives in data from high-throughput interaction techniques. The program is available from ftp://ftp.mshri.on.ca/pub/BIND/Tools/MCODE.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective was to identify severity characteristics of initial chikungunya infection (CHIKV) stages associated with post-CHIKV arthritis and arthralgia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: French gendarmes exposed to the 2005-2006 CHIKV epidemic in Reunion Island who completed the 2006 (self-reporting acute and early chronic [median: 6 months] symptoms) and 2008 (Endpoint [median: 30 months]: self-perceived recovery and rheumatic disorders (RDs)) surveys were included. Multinomial logistic regression and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) were used. Arthralgia was defined by joint pain and/or stiffness and arthritis by joint swelling in addition to pain and/or stiffness.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In 2008, 124 (31.3{\%})/403 participants (101 CHIKV+/302 CHIKV-) reported arthralgia and 57 (14.1{\%}) arthritis. The multivariate model kept CHIKV infection, comorbidity and acute stage depressed mood as independent prognostic factors for both arthralgia and arthritis, but found early chronic stage RD as the main determinant of the same RD two years later.The MCA performed with the 85 CHIKV + patients who answered the question on self-perceived recovery enabled the calculation of severity scores based on initial symptoms that were strongly associated with persistent arthritis and, to a lesser extent, to arthralgia in bivariate analyses. The MCA graph clearly distinguished arthritis as the only RD associated with early severity indicators represented by sick leave, joint swelling and depressed mood during the acute stage, and early chronification of arthritis and depressed mood.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Initial CHIKV severity predicted recovery, with higher severity associated with arthritis and lower severity with arthralgia. More interestingly, specific markers of post-CHIKV arthritis, which can easily be used by clinicians for case management, were identified.},

abstract = {The 1918 influenza pandemic was exceptionally severe, resulting in the death of up to 50 million people worldwide. Here, we show which virus genes contributed to the replication and virulence of the 1918 influenza virus. Recombinant viruses, in which genes of the 1918 virus were replaced with genes from a contemporary human H1N1 influenza virus, A/Texas/36/91 (Tx/91), were generated. The exchange of most 1918 influenza virus genes with seasonal influenza H1N1 virus genes did not alter the virulence of the 1918 virus; however, substitution of the hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), or polymerase subunit PB1 genes significantly affected the ability of this virus to cause severe disease in mice. The 1918 virus virulence observed in mice correlated with the ability of 1918 recombinant viruses to replicate efficiently in human airway cells. In a second series of experiments, eight 1918 1:7 recombinants were generated, in which each Tx/91 virus gene was individually replaced by a corresponding gene from 1918 virus. Replication capacity of the individual 1:7 reassortant viruses was assessed in mouse lungs and human airway cells. Increased virus titers were observed among 1:7 viruses containing individual 1918 HA, NA, and PB1 genes. In addition, the 1918 PB1:Tx/91 (1:7) virus showed a distinctly larger plaque size phenotype than the small plaque phenotype of the 1918 PA:Tx/91 and 1918 PB2:Tx/91 1:7 reassortants. These results highlight the importance of the 1918 HA, NA, and PB1 genes for optimal virus replication and virulence of this pandemic strain.},

abstract = {Quinolones are synthetic antibiotics and the main cause of resistance to these antimicrobials is mutation of the genes encoding their targets. However, differing to other organisms, such mutations have not been found in quinolone resistant Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates, in which overproduction of the SmeDEF efflux pump is a major cause of quinolone resistance. SmeDEF is chromosomally encoded and highly conserved in all studied S. maltophilia strains; it is an ancient element that evolved over millions of years in this species. It seems then difficult that its main function would be resistance to quinolones, a family of synthetic antibiotics not present in natural environments until the last decades. Expression of SmeDEF is tightly controlled by the transcriptional repressor SmeT. Our work shows that plant-produced flavonoids can bind SmeT releasing it from smeDEF and smeT operators. Antibiotics extruded by SmeDEF do not impede the binding of SmeT to DNA. The fact that plant-produced flavonoids specifically induce smeDEF expression indicate they are bona fide effectors regulating expression of this resistance determinant. Expression of efflux pumps is usually down-regulated, unless their activity is needed. Since smeDEF expression is triggered by plant-produced flavonoids, we reasoned this efflux pump may have a role in the colonization of plants by S. maltophilia. Our results showed that, indeed, deletion of smeE impairs S. maltophilia colonization of plant roots. Altogether, our results indicate that quinolone resistance is a recent function of SmeDEF and the colonization of plant roots is likely one original function of this efflux pump.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE International guidelines recommend treatment with statins for patients with preexisting ischemic heart disease to prevent additional cardiovascular events but differ regarding target levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Trial data on this question are inconclusive and observational data are lacking. OBJECTIVE To assess the relationship between levels of LDL-C achieved with statin treatment and cardiovascular events in adherent patients with preexisting ischemic heart disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Population-based observational cohort study from 2009 to 2013 using data from a health care organization in Israel covering more than 4.3 million members. Included patients had ischemic heart disease, were aged 30 to 84 years, were treated with statins, and were at least 80{\%} adherent to treatment or, in a sensitivity analysis, at least 50{\%} adherent. Patients with active cancer or metabolic abnormalities were excluded. EXPOSURES Index LDL-C was defined as the first achieved serum LDL-C measure after at least 1 year of statin treatment, grouped as low (≤70.0 mg/dL), moderate (70.1-100.0 mg/dL), or high (100.1-130.0 mg/dL). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Major adverse cardiac events included acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, angioplasty, bypass surgery, or all-cause mortality. The hazard ratio of adverse outcomes was estimated using 2 Cox proportional hazards models with low vs moderate and moderate vs high LDL-C, adjusted for confounders and further tested using propensity score matching analysis. RESULTS The cohort with at least 80{\%} adherence included 31 619 patients, for whom the mean (SD) age was 67.3 (9.8) years. Of this population, 27{\%} were female and 29{\%} had low, 53{\%} moderate, and 18{\%} high LDL-C when taking statin treatment. Overall, there were 9035 patients who had an adverse outcome during a mean 1.6 years of follow-up (6.7 per 1000 persons per year). The adjusted incidence of adverse outcomes was not different between low and moderate LDL-C (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02; 95{\%} CI, 0.97-1.07; P = .54), but it was lower with moderate vs high LDL-C (HR, 0.89; 95{\%} CI, 0.84-0.94; P {\textless} .001). Among 54 884 patients with at least 50{\%} statin adherence, the adjusted HR was 1.06 (95{\%} CI, 1.02-1.10; P = .001) in the low vs moderate groups and 0.87 (95{\%} CI, 0.84-0.91; P = .001) in the moderate vs high groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients with LDL-C levels of 70 to 100 mg/dL taking statins had lower risk of adverse cardiac outcomes compared with those with LDL-C levels between 100 and 130 mg/dL, but no additional benefit was gained by achieving LDL-C of 70 mg/dL or less. These population-based data do not support treatment guidelines recommending very low target LDL-C levels for all patients with preexisting heart disease.},

These infections place tremendous burdens on the health care system and create situations for misuse of antimicrobial drugs. Recognition of these factors has led professional societies, clinicians, and hospitals to develop programs to improve the management of HAIs and the use of antimicrobial drugs. The clinical literature is replete with examples of these programs, often referred to as antimicrobial stewardship. Traditionally, antimicrobial stewardship programs have relied on manual methods combined with clinical oversight and intervention. The advent of modern health care information technology offers the opportunity to expand the breadth and depth of these programs.

abstract = {Studies of the relationship between DNA variation and gene expression variation, often referred to as "expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping", have been conducted in many species and resulted in many significant findings. Because of the large number of genes and genetic markers in such analyses, it is extremely challenging to discover how a small number of eQTLs interact with each other to affect mRNA expression levels for a set of co-regulated genes. We present a Bayesian method to facilitate the task, in which co-expressed genes mapped to a common set of markers are treated as a module characterized by latent indicator variables. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is designed to search simultaneously for the module genes and their linked markers. We show by simulations that this method is more powerful for detecting true eQTLs and their target genes than traditional QTL mapping methods. We applied the procedure to a data set consisting of gene expression and genotypes for 112 segregants of S. cerevisiae. Our method identified modules containing genes mapped to previously reported eQTL hot spots, and dissected these large eQTL hot spots into several modules corresponding to possibly different biological functions or primary and secondary responses to regulatory perturbations. In addition, we identified nine modules associated with pairs of eQTLs, of which two have been previously reported. We demonstrated that one of the novel modules containing many daughter-cell expressed genes is regulated by AMN1 and BPH1. In conclusion, the Bayesian partition method which simultaneously considers all traits and all markers is more powerful for detecting both pleiotropic and epistatic effects based on both simulated and empirical data.},

abstract = {Systems immunology is an emerging paradigm that aims at a more systematic and quantitative understanding of the immune system. Two major approaches have been utilized to date in this field: unbiased data-driven modeling to comprehensively identify molecular and cellular components of a system and their interactions; and hypothesis-based quantitative modeling to understand the operating principles of a system by extracting a minimal set of variables and rules underlying them. In this review, we describe applications of the two approaches to the study of viral infections and autoimmune diseases in humans, and discuss possible ways by which these two approaches can synergize when applied to human immunology. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Insulin resistance is necessary but not sufficient for the development of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes results when pancreatic beta-cells fail to compensate for insulin resistance by increasing insulin production through an expansion of beta-cell mass or increased insulin secretion. Communication between insulin target tissues and beta-cells may initiate this compensatory response. Correlated changes in gene expression between tissues can provide evidence for such intercellular communication. We profiled gene expression in six tissues of mice from an obesity-induced diabetes-resistant and a diabetes-susceptible strain before and after the onset of diabetes. We studied the correlation structure of mRNA abundance and identified 105 co-expression gene modules. We provide an interactive gene network model showing the correlation structure between the expression modules within and among the six tissues. This resource also provides a searchable database of gene expression profiles for all genes in six tissues in lean and obese diabetes-resistant and diabetes-susceptible mice, at 4 and 10 wk of age. A cell cycle regulatory module in islets predicts diabetes susceptibility. The module predicts islet replication; we found a strong correlation between (2)H(2)O incorporation into islet DNA in vivo and the expression pattern of the cell cycle module. This pattern is highly correlated with that of several individual genes in insulin target tissues, including Igf2, which has been shown to promote beta-cell proliferation, suggesting that these genes may provide a link between insulin resistance and beta-cell proliferation.},

The reassortants were characterized with respect to their genetic content and pneumovirulence for mice. The reassortants fell into three categories: avirulent, highly virulent (resembling in this respect the parent A/Aichi/2/68 virus) and moderately virulent (resembling the mouse-adapted A/USSR/90/77 parent virus). The analysis of the parental origin of the genes of 6 reassortants allowed to suggest that changes in the HA gene and in a polymerase gene (most likely, PB1) were necessary for the acquisition of virulence by the A/USSR/90/77 virus in the course of adaptation to mice, whereas the changes in two other polymerase genes as well as in the genes NA and NS were not involved. The low degree of pathogenicity characteristic of the mouse-adapted A/USSR/90/77 virus was determined by gene(s) other than HA.},

abstract = {Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells are a minor subset of T cells in human blood and differ from other T cells by their immediate responsiveness to microbes. We previously demonstrated that the primary target for Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells is (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate (HMB-PP), an essential metabolite produced by a large range of pathogens. Here we wished to study the consequence of this unique responsiveness in microbial infection. The majority of peripheral Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells shares migration properties with circulating monocytes, which explains the presence of these two distinct blood cell types in the inflammatory infiltrate at sites of infection and suggests that they synergize in anti-microbial immune responses. Our present findings demonstrate a rapid and HMB-PP-dependent crosstalk between Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells and autologous monocytes that results in the immediate production of inflammatory mediators including the cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and oncostatin M (OSM); the chemokines CCL2, CXCL8, and CXCL10; and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Moreover, under these co-culture conditions monocytes differentiate within 18 hours into inflammatory dendritic cells (DCs) with antigen-presenting functions. Addition of further microbial stimuli (lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan) induces CCR7 and enables these inflammatory DCs to trigger the generation of CD4(+) effector alphabeta T cells expressing IFN-gamma and/or IL-17. Importantly, our in vitro model replicates the responsiveness to microbes of effluent cells from peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients and translates directly to episodes of acute PD-associated bacterial peritonitis, where Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cell numbers and soluble inflammatory mediators are elevated in patients infected with HMB-PP-producing pathogens. Collectively, these findings suggest a direct link between invading pathogens, microbe-responsive gammadelta T cells, and monocytes in the inflammatory infiltrate, which plays a crucial role in the early response and the generation of microbe-specific immunity.},

It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

abstract = {The primary cause of poor outcome following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is disease recurrence. Detection of increasing minimal residual disease (MRD) following HCT may permit early intervention to prevent clinical relapse; however, MRD quantification remains an uncommon diagnostic test because of logistical and financial barriers to widespread use. Here we describe a method for quantifying CLL MRD using widely available consensus primers for amplification of all Ig heavy chain (IGH) genes in a mixture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, followed by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) for disease-specific IGH sequence quantification. To achieve accurate MRD quantification, we developed a systematic bioinformatic methodology to aggregate cancer clone sequence variants arising from systematic and random artifacts occurring during IGH-HTS. We then compared the sensitivity of IGH-HTS, flow cytometry, and allele-specific oligonucleotide PCR for MRD quantification in 28 samples collected from 6 CLL patients following allogeneic HCT. Using amplimer libraries generated with consensus primers from patient blood samples, we demonstrate the sensitivity of IGH-HTS with 454 pyrosequencing to be 10(-5), with a high correlation between quantification by allele-specific oligonucleotide PCR and IGH-HTS (r = 0.85). From the same dataset used to quantify MRD, IGH-HTS also allowed us to profile IGH repertoire reconstitution after HCT-information not provided by the other MRD methods. IGH-HTS using consensus primers will broaden the availability of MRD quantification in CLL and other B cell malignancies, and this approach has potential for quantitative evaluation of immune diversification following transplant and nontransplant therapies.},

abstract = {DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs) are a hallmark of cancer genomes. However, little is known about how such changes affect global gene expression. We develop a modeling framework, EPoC (Endogenous Perturbation analysis of Cancer), to (1) detect disease-driving CNAs and their effect on target mRNA expression, and to (2) stratify cancer patients into long- and short-term survivors. Our method constructs causal network models of gene expression by combining genome-wide DNA- and RNA-level data. Prognostic scores are obtained from a singular value decomposition of the networks. By applying EPoC to glioblastoma data from The Cancer Genome Atlas consortium, we demonstrate that the resulting network models contain known disease-relevant hub genes, reveal interesting candidate hubs, and uncover predictors of patient survival. Targeted validations in four glioblastoma cell lines support selected predictions, and implicate the p53-interacting protein Necdin in suppressing glioblastoma cell growth. We conclude that large-scale network modeling of the effects of CNAs on gene expression may provide insights into the biology of human cancer. Free software in MATLAB and R is provided.},

abstract = {In a study comparing the effects of two treatments, the propensity score is the probability of assignment to one treatment conditional on a subject's measured baseline covariates. Propensity-score matching is increasingly being used to estimate the effects of exposures using observational data. In the most common implementation of propensity-score matching, pairs of treated and untreated subjects are formed whose propensity scores differ by at most a pre-specified amount (the caliper width). There has been a little research into the optimal caliper width. We conducted an extensive series of Monte Carlo simulations to determine the optimal caliper width for estimating differences in means (for continuous outcomes) and risk differences (for binary outcomes). When estimating differences in means or risk differences, we recommend that researchers match on the logit of the propensity score using calipers of width equal to 0.2 of the standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score. When at least some of the covariates were continuous, then either this value, or one close to it, minimized the mean square error of the resultant estimated treatment effect. It also eliminated at least 98{\%} of the bias in the crude estimator, and it resulted in confidence intervals with approximately the correct coverage rates. Furthermore, the empirical type I error rate was approximately correct. When all of the covariates were binary, then the choice of caliper width had a much smaller impact on the performance of estimation of risk differences and differences in means.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Clinical trial registries are in widespread use to promote transparency around trials and their results.

OBJECTIVE:To describe characteristics of drug trials listed in ClinicalTrials.gov and examine whether the funding source of these trials is associated with favorable published outcomes.

DESIGN:An observational study of safety and efficacy trials for anticholesteremics, antidepressants, antipsychotics, proton-pump inhibitors, and vasodilators conducted between 2000 and 2006.

SETTING:ClinicalTrials.gov, a Web-based registry of clinical trials launched in 1999.

MEASUREMENTS:Publications resulting from the trials for the 5 drug categories of interest were identified, and data were abstracted on the trial record and publication, including timing of registration, elements of the study design, funding source, publication date, and study outcomes. Assessments were based on the primary funding categories of industry, government agencies, and nonprofit or nonfederal organizations.

RESULTS:Among 546 drug trials, 346 (63{\%}) were primarily funded by industry, 74 (14{\%}) by government sources, and 126 (23{\%}) by nonprofit or nonfederal organizations. Trials funded by industry were more likely to be phase 3 or 4 trials (88.7{\%}; P {\textless} 0.001 across groups), to use an active comparator in controlled trials (36.8{\%}; P = 0.010 across groups), to be multicenter (89.0{\%}; P {\textless} 0.001 across groups), and to enroll more participants (median sample size, 306 participants; P {\textless} 0.001 across groups). Overall, 362 (66.3{\%}) trials had published results. Industry-funded trials reported positive outcomes in 85.4{\%} of publications, compared with 50.0{\%} for government-funded trials and 71.9{\%} for nonprofit or nonfederal organization-funded trials (P {\textless} 0.001). Trials funded by nonprofit or nonfederal sources with industry contributions were also more likely to report positive outcomes than those without industry funding (85.0{\%} vs. 61.2{\%}; P = 0.013). Rates of trial publication within 24 months of study completion ranged from 32.4{\%} among industry-funded trials to 56.2{\%} among nonprofit or nonfederal organization-funded trials without industry contributions (P = 0.005 across groups).

LIMITATIONS:The publication status of a trial could not always be confirmed, which could result in misclassification. Additional information on study protocols and comprehensive trial results were not available to further explore underlying factors for the association between funding source and outcome reporting.

CONCLUSION:In this sample of registered drug trials, those funded by industry were less likely to be published within 2 years of study completion and were more likely to report positive outcomes than were trials funded by other sources.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is one of the most common emerging multi-drug resistant organisms found in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis and its prevalence is increasing. Chronic infection with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has recently been shown to be an independent predictor of pulmonary exacerbation requiring hospitalization and antibiotics. However, the role of antibiotic treatment of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection in people with cystic fibrosis is still unclear. OBJECTIVES: The objective of our review is to assess the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in people with cystic fibrosis. The primary objective is to assess this in relation to lung function and pulmonary exacerbations in the setting of acute pulmonary exacerbations. The secondary objective is to assess this in relation to the eradication of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched a registry of ongoing trials and the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews.Date of latest search: 06 July 2011. SELECTION CRITERIA: Any randomized controlled trial of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia mono-infection or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia co-infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in either the setting of an acute pulmonary exacerbation or a chronic infection treated with suppressive antibiotic therapy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both authors independently assessed the trials identified by the search for potential inclusion in the review. MAIN RESULTS: The initial search strategy identified only one study of antibiotic treatment of pulmonary exacerbations that included cystic fibrosis patients with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. However, this study had to be excluded because data was not available per pathogen. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review did not identify any evidence regarding the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in people with cystic fibrosis. Until such evidence becomes available, clinicians need to use their clinical judgement as to whether or not to treat Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection in patients with cystic fibrosis. Randomized clinical trials are needed to address these unanswered clinical questions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: High throughput sequencing has become an important technology for studying expression levels in many types of genomic, and particularly transcriptomic, data. One key way of analysing such data is to look for elements of the data which display particular patterns of differential expression in order to take these forward for further analysis and validation.

RESULTS: We propose a framework for defining patterns of differential expression and develop a novel algorithm, baySeq, which uses an empirical Bayes approach to detect these patterns of differential expression within a set of sequencing samples. The method assumes a negative binomial distribution for the data and derives an empirically determined prior distribution from the entire dataset. We examine the performance of the method on real and simulated data.

CONCLUSIONS: Our method performs at least as well, and often better, than existing methods for analyses of pairwise differential expression in both real and simulated data. When we compare methods for the analysis of data from experimental designs involving multiple sample groups, our method again shows substantial gains in performance. We believe that this approach thus represents an important step forward for the analysis of count data from sequencing experiments.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data-driven risk stratification models built using data from a single hospital often have a paucity of training data. However, leveraging data from other hospitals can be challenging owing to institutional differences with patients and with data coding and capture.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate three approaches to learning hospital-specific predictions about the risk of hospital-associated infection with Clostridium difficile, and perform a comparative analysis of the value of different ways of using external data to enhance hospital-specific predictions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated each approach on 132 853 admissions from three hospitals, varying in size and location. The first approach was a single-task approach, in which only training data from the target hospital (ie, the hospital for which the model was intended) were used. The second used only data from the other two hospitals. The third approach jointly incorporated data from all hospitals while seeking a solution in the target space.

RESULTS: The relative performance of the three different approaches was found to be sensitive to the hospital selected as the target. However, incorporating data from all hospitals consistently had the highest performance.

DISCUSSION: The results characterize the challenges and opportunities that come with (1) using data or models from collections of hospitals without adapting them to the site at which the model will be used, and (2) using only local data to build models for small institutions or rare events.

CONCLUSIONS: We show how external data from other hospitals can be successfully and efficiently incorporated into hospital-specific models.},

abstract = {Despite a large increase in Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) severity, morbidity and mortality in the US since the early 2000s, CDI burden estimates have had limited generalizability and comparability due to widely varying clinical settings, populations, or study designs. A decision-analytic model incorporating key input parameters important in CDI epidemiology was developed to estimate the annual number of initial and recurrent CDI cases, attributable and all-cause deaths, economic burden in the general population, and specific number of high-risk patients in different healthcare settings and the community in the US. Economic burden was calculated adopting a societal perspective using a bottom-up approach that identified healthcare resources consumed in the management of CDI. Annually, a total of 606,058 (439,237 initial and 166,821 recurrent) episodes of CDI were predicted in 2014: 34.3 {\%} arose from community exposure. Over 44,500 CDI-attributable deaths in 2014 were estimated to occur. High-risk susceptible individuals representing 5 {\%} of the total hospital population accounted for 23 {\%} of hospitalized CDI patients. The economic cost of CDI was {\$}5.4 billion ({\$}4.7 billion (86.7 {\%}) in healthcare settings; {\$}725 million (13.3 {\%}) in the community), mostly due to hospitalization. A modeling framework provides more comprehensive and detailed national-level estimates of CDI cases, recurrences, deaths and cost in different patient groups than currently available from separate individual studies. As new treatments for CDI are developed, this model can provide reliable estimates to better focus healthcare resources to those specific age-groups, risk-groups, and care settings in the US where they are most needed.

However, the cellular proteome comprises many more potential analytes, and current mass cytometry instrumentation allows for theoretically up to 121 different mass detection channels. The labeling of specific probes with appropriate metal ions is a significant hurdle for exploiting more of mass cytometry's analytical capacity. To this end, we here describe the labeling of antibody with natural abundance or isotopically purified platinum as formulated in cisplatin and circumventing the use of chelator-loaded polymers. We confirm the utility of cisplatin–antibody-conjugates for surface, intracellular, and phosphoepitope-specific immunophenotyping, as well as for application in cell surface CD45-based barcoding. Cisplatin-labeling of antibody increases the analytical capacity of the CyTOF{\textregistered} platform by two channels based on available reagents, and has the potential to add a total of six channels for detection of specific probes, thus helping to better extend the analytical mass range of mass cytometers. {\textcopyright} 2015 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Existing repositories for experimental datasets typically capture snapshots of data acquired using a single experimental technique and often require manual population and continual curation. We present a storage system for heterogeneous research data that performs dynamic automated indexing to provide powerful search, discovery and collaboration features without the restrictions of a structured repository. ADAM is able to index many commonly used file formats generated by laboratory assays and therefore offers specific advantages to the experimental biology community. However, it is not domain specific and can promote sharing and re-use of working data across scientific disciplines.

abstract = {Fast and accurate identification and typing of pathogens are essential for effective surveillance and outbreak detection. The current routine procedure is based on a variety of techniques, making the procedure laborious, time-consuming, and expensive. With whole-genome sequencing (WGS) becoming cheaper, it has huge potential in both diagnostics and routine surveillance. The aim of this study was to perform a real-time evaluation of WGS for routine typing and surveillance of verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC). In Denmark, the Statens Serum Institut (SSI) routinely receives all suspected VTEC isolates. During a 7-week period in the fall of 2012, all incoming isolates were concurrently subjected to WGS using IonTorrent PGM. Real-time bioinformatics analysis was performed using web-tools (www.genomicepidemiology.org) for species determination, multilocus sequence type (MLST) typing, and determination of phylogenetic relationship, and a specific VirulenceFinder for detection of E. coli virulence genes was developed as part of this study. In total, 46 suspected VTEC isolates were characterized in parallel during the study. VirulenceFinder proved successful in detecting virulence genes included in routine typing, explicitly verocytotoxin 1 (vtx1), verocytotoxin 2 (vtx2), and intimin (eae), and also detected additional virulence genes. VirulenceFinder is also a robust method for assigning verocytotoxin (vtx) subtypes. A real-time clustering of isolates in agreement with the epidemiology was established from WGS, enabling discrimination between sporadic and outbreak isolates. Overall, WGS typing produced results faster and at a lower cost than the current routine. Therefore, WGS typing is a superior alternative to conventional typing strategies. This approach may also be applied to typing and surveillance of other pathogens.},

abstract = {Hannenhalli and Pevzner gave the first polynomial-time algorithm for computing the inversion distance between two signed permutations, as part of the larger task of determining the shortest sequence of inversions needed to transform one permutation into the other. Their algorithm (restricted to distance calculation) proceeds in two stages: in the first stage, the overlap graph induced by the permutation is decomposed into connected components; then, in the second stage, certain graph structures (hurdles and others) are identified. Berman and Hannenhalli avoided the explicit computation of the overlap graph and gave an O(nalpha(n)) algorithm, based on a Union-Find structure, to find its connected components, where alpha is the inverse Ackerman function. Since for all practical purposes alpha(n) is a constant no larger than four, this algorithm has been the fastest practical algorithm to date. In this paper, we present a new linear-time algorithm for computing the connected components, which is more efficient than that of Berman and Hannenhalli in both theory and practice. Our algorithm uses only a stack and is very easy to implement. We give the results of computational experiments over a large range of permutation pairs produced through simulated evolution; our experiments show a speed-up by a factor of 2 to 5 in the computation of the connected components and by a factor of 1.3 to 2 in the overall distance computation.},

In this report, we describe the case of an expectant mother who had a febrile illness with rash at the end of the first trimester of pregnancy while she was living in Brazil. Ultrasonography performed at 29 weeks of gestation revealed microcephaly with calcifications in the fetal brain and placenta. After the mother requested termination of the pregnancy, a fetal autopsy was performed. Micrencephaly (an abnormally small brain) was observed, with almost complete agyria, hydrocephalus, and multifocal dystrophic calcifications in the cortex and subcortical white matter, with associated cortical displacement and mild focal inflammation. ZIKV was found in the fetal brain tissue on reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay, with consistent findings on electron microscopy.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Zika virus (ZIKV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and dengue virus (DENV) co-circulate in Nicaragua. In this study, we sought to compare the quantified viremia and clinical presentation of patients infected with one or more of these viruses. METHODS Acute-phase serum samples from 346 patients with a suspected arboviral illness were tested using a multiplex real-time RT-PCR for ZIKV, CHIKV, and DENV. Viremia was quantitated for each detected virus, and clinical information was recorded from request forms submitted with each sample. RESULTS Two hundred sixty-three patients tested positive for one or more viruses: 192 patients tested positive for a single virus (mono-infections) and 71 patients tested positive for two or all three viruses (co-infections). Quantifiable viremia was lower in ZIKV infections compared to CHIKV or DENV (mean 4.70 vs 6.42 and 5.84 log10 copies/mL serum, respectively; p{\textless}0.001 for both comparisons), and for each virus, mean viremia was significantly lower in co-infections than in mono-infections. Compared to patients with CHIKV or DENV, ZIKV patients were more likely to have a rash (p{\textless}0.001) and less likely to be febrile (p{\textless}0.05) or require hospitalization (p{\textless}0.001). Among all patients, hospitalized cases had higher viremia than those who did not require hospitalization (7.1 vs 4.1 log10 copies/mL serum, respectively; p{\textless}0.001). CONCLUSIONS ZIKV, CHIKV, and DENV result in similar clinical presentations, and co-infections may be relatively common.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments have been popularly applied to transcriptome studies in recent years. Such experiments are still relatively costly. As a result, RNA-seq experiments often employ a small number of replicates. Power analysis and sample size calculation are challenging in the context of differential expression analysis with RNA-seq data. One challenge is that there are no closed-form formulae to calculate power for the popularly applied tests for differential expression analysis. In addition, false discovery rate (FDR), instead of family-wise type I error rate, is controlled for the multiple testing error in RNA-seq data analysis. So far, there are very few proposals on sample size calculation for RNA-seq experiments.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In this paper, we propose a procedure for sample size calculation while controlling FDR for RNA-seq experimental design. Our procedure is based on the weighted linear model analysis facilitated by the voom method which has been shown to have competitive performance in terms of power and FDR control for RNA-seq differential expression analysis. We derive a method that approximates the average power across the differentially expressed genes, and then calculate the sample size to achieve a desired average power while controlling FDR. Simulation results demonstrate that the actual power of several popularly applied tests for differential expression is achieved and is close to the desired power for RNA-seq data with sample size calculated based on our method.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our proposed method provides an efficient algorithm to calculate sample size while controlling FDR for RNA-seq experimental design. We also provide an R package ssizeRNA that implements our proposed method and can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network ( http://cran.r-project.org ).},

The current evidence on the performance of ACOs is reviewed. Since California has the largest number of ACOs (N=67) and a history of providing care under risk-bearing contracts, some additional assessments of quality and patient experience are made between California ACOs and non-ACO provider organizations. Six key issues likely to affect future ACO growth and development are discussed, and some potential "diagnostic" indicators for assessing the likelihood of potential antitrust violations are presented.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple genome alignment remains a challenging problem. Effects of recombination including rearrangement, segmental duplication, gain, and loss can create a mosaic pattern of homology even among closely related organisms. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We describe a new method to align two or more genomes that have undergone rearrangements due to recombination and substantial amounts of segmental gain and loss (flux). We demonstrate that the new method can accurately align regions conserved in some, but not all, of the genomes, an important case not handled by our previous work. The method uses a novel alignment objective score called a sum-of-pairs breakpoint score, which facilitates accurate detection of rearrangement breakpoints when genomes have unequal gene content. We also apply a probabilistic alignment filtering method to remove erroneous alignments of unrelated sequences, which are commonly observed in other genome alignment methods. We describe new metrics for quantifying genome alignment accuracy which measure the quality of rearrangement breakpoint predictions and indel predictions. The new genome alignment algorithm demonstrates high accuracy in situations where genomes have undergone biologically feasible amounts of genome rearrangement, segmental gain and loss. We apply the new algorithm to a set of 23 genomes from the genera Escherichia, Shigella, and Salmonella. Analysis of whole-genome multiple alignments allows us to extend the previously defined concepts of core- and pan-genomes to include not only annotated genes, but also non-coding regions with potential regulatory roles. The 23 enterobacteria have an estimated core-genome of 2.46Mbp conserved among all taxa and a pan-genome of 15.2Mbp. We document substantial population-level variability among these organisms driven by segmental gain and loss. Interestingly, much variability lies in intergenic regions, suggesting that the Enterobacteriacae may exhibit regulatory divergence. CONCLUSIONS: The multiple genome alignments generated by our software provide a platform for comparative genomic and population genomic studies. Free, open-source software implementing the described genome alignment approach is available from http://gel.ahabs.wisc.edu/mauve.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) genes predictive of survival have been found in both adjacent normal (AN) and tumor (TU) tissues. The relationships between these two sets of predictive genes and the general process of tumorigenesis and disease progression remains unclear.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we have investigated HCC tumorigenesis by comparing gene expression, DNA copy number variation and survival using ∼250 AN and TU samples representing, respectively, the pre-cancer state, and the result of tumorigenesis. Genes that participate in tumorigenesis were defined using a gene-gene correlation meta-analysis procedure that compared AN versus TU tissues. Genes predictive of survival in AN (AN-survival genes) were found to be enriched in the differential gene-gene correlation gene set indicating that they directly participate in the process of tumorigenesis. Additionally the AN-survival genes were mostly not predictive after tumorigenesis in TU tissue and this transition was associated with and could largely be explained by the effect of somatic DNA copy number variation (sCNV) in cis and in trans. The data was consistent with the variance of AN-survival genes being rate-limiting steps in tumorigenesis and this was confirmed using a treatment that promotes HCC tumorigenesis that selectively altered AN-survival genes and genes differentially correlated between AN and TU.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This suggests that the process of tumor evolution involves rate-limiting steps related to the background from which the tumor evolved where these were frequently predictive of clinical outcome. Additionally treatments that alter the likelihood of tumorigenesis occurring may act by altering AN-survival genes, suggesting that the process can be manipulated. Further sCNV explains a substantial fraction of tumor specific expression and may therefore be a causal driver of tumor evolution in HCC and perhaps many solid tumor types.},

The impetus for this system has come from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Modernization Act of 1997, which mandated a registry of both federally and privately funded clinical trials "of experimental treatments for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions." The system design and implementation have been guided by several principles. First, all stages of system development were guided by the needs of the primary intended audience, patients and other members of the public. Second, broad agreement on a common set of data elements was obtained. Third, the system was designed in a modular and extensible way, and search methods that take extensive advantage of the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) were developed. Finally, since this will be a long-term effort involving many individuals and organizations, the project is being implemented in several phases.},

abstract = {Azole compounds are the primary therapy for patients with diseases caused by Aspergillus fumigatus. However, prolonged treatment may cause resistance to develop, which is associated with treatment failure. The azole target cyp51A is a hotspot for mutations that confer phenotypic resistance, but in an increasing number of resistant isolates the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we report the discovery of a novel resistance mechanism, caused by a mutation in the CCAAT-binding transcription factor complex subunit HapE. From one patient, four A. fumigatus isolates were serially collected. The last two isolates developed an azole resistant phenotype during prolonged azole therapy. Because the resistant isolates contained a wild type cyp51A gene and the isolates were isogenic, the complete genomes of the last susceptible isolate and the first resistant isolate (taken 17 weeks apart) were sequenced using Illumina technology to identify the resistance conferring mutation. By comparing the genome sequences to each other as well as to two A. fumigatus reference genomes, several potential non-synonymous mutations in protein-coding regions were identified, six of which could be confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Subsequent sexual crossing experiments showed that resistant progeny always contained a P88L substitution in HapE, while the presence of the other five mutations did not correlate with resistance in the progeny. Cloning the mutated hapE gene into the azole susceptible akuB(KU80) strain showed that the HapE P88L mutation by itself could confer the resistant phenotype. This is the first time that whole genome sequencing and sexual crossing strategies have been used to find the genetic basis of a trait of interest in A. fumigatus. The discovery may help understand alternate pathways for azole resistance in A. fumigatus with implications for the molecular diagnosis of resistance and drug discovery.},

Infection with any of the four dengue serotypes induces protective immunity to that serotype, but does not confer long-term protection against infection by other serotypes. The immunological interactions between serotypes are of central importance in understanding epidemiological dynamics and anticipating the impact of dengue vaccines. We analysed a 38-year time series with 12 197 serotyped dengue infections from a hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. Using novel mechanistic models to represent different hypothesized immune interactions between serotypes, we found strong evidence that infection with dengue provides substantial short-term cross-protection against other serotypes (approx. 1-3 years). This is the first quantitative evidence that short-term cross-protection exists since human experimental infection studies performed in the 1950s. These findings will impact strategies for designing dengue vaccine studies, future multi-strain modelling efforts, and our understanding of evolutionary pressures in multi-strain disease systems.},

We screened 813 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs targeting 245 human ISGs using a flow cytometry approach to identify genes that modulated infection of West Nile virus (WNV) in IFN-$\beta$-treated human cells. Thirty ISGs with inhibitory effects against WNV were identified, including several novel genes that had antiviral activity against related and unrelated positive-strand RNA viruses. We also defined one ISG, activating signal cointegrator complex 3 (ASCC3), which functioned as a negative regulator of the host defense response. Silencing of ASCC3 resulted in upregulation of multiple antiviral ISGs, which correlated with inhibition of infection of several positive-strand RNA viruses. Reciprocally, ectopic expression of human ASCC3 or mouse Ascc3 resulted in downregulation of ISGs and increased viral infection. Mechanism-of-action and RNA sequencing studies revealed that ASCC3 functions to modulate ISG expression in an IRF-3- and IRF-7-dependent manner. Compared to prior ectopic ISG expression studies, our shRNA screen identified novel ISGs that restrict infection of WNV and other viruses and defined a new counterregulatory ISG, ASCC3, which tempers cell-intrinsic immunity.},

abstract = {Background. Change from nonmolecular to molecular testing techniques is thought to contribute to the increasing trend in incidence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI); however the degree of effect attributed to this versus other time-related epidemiologic factors is unclear. Methods. We compared the relative change in incidence rate (IRR) of healthcare facility-associated (HCFA) CDI among hospitals in the Duke Infection Control Outreach Network before and after the date of switch from nonmolecular tests to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using prospectively collected surveillance data from July 2009 to December 2011. Data from 10 hospitals that switched and 22 control hospitals were included. Individual hospital estimates were determined using Poisson regression. We used an interrupted time series approach to develop a Poisson mixed-effects model. Additional regression adjustments were made for clustering and proportion of intensive care unit patient-days. The variable for PCR was treated as a fixed effect; other modeled variables were random effects. Results. For those hospitals that switched to PCR, mean incidence rate of HCFA CDI before the switch was 6.0 CDIs per 10,000 patient-days compared with 9.6 CDIs per 10,000 patient-days after the switch. Estimates of hospital-specific IRR that compared after the switch with before the switch ranged from 0.89 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.32-2.44) to 6.91 (95{\%} CI, 1.12-42.54). After adjustment in the mixed-effects model, the overall IRR comparing CDI incidence after the switch to before the switch was 1.56 (95{\%} CI, 1.28-1.90). Time-trend variables did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion. Hospitals that switched from nonmolecular to molecular tests experienced an approximate 56{\%} increase in the rate of HCFA CDI after testing change.},

However, the error rates of single-molecule reads are high, which has limited their use thus far to resequencing bacteria. To address this limitation, we introduce a correction algorithm and assembly strategy that uses short, high-fidelity sequences to correct the error in single-molecule sequences. We demonstrate the utility of this approach on reads generated by a PacBio RS instrument from phage, prokaryotic and eukaryotic whole genomes, including the previously unsequenced genome of the parrot Melopsittacus undulatus, as well as for RNA-Seq reads of the corn (Zea mays) transcriptome. Our long-read correction achieves {\textgreater}99.9{\%} base-call accuracy, leading to substantially better assemblies than current sequencing strategies: in the best example, the median contig size was quintupled relative to high-coverage, second-generation assemblies. Greater gains are predicted if read lengths continue to increase, including the prospect of single-contig bacterial chromosome assembly.},

abstract = {Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an opportunistic pathogen characterized for its intrinsic low susceptibility to several antibiotics. Part of this low susceptibility relies on the expression of chromosomally encoded multidrug efflux pumps, with SmeDEF being the most relevant antibiotic resistance efflux pump so far studied in this bacterial species. Expression of smeDEF is down-regulated by the SmeT repressor, encoded upstream smeDEF, in its complementary DNA strand. In the present article we present the crystal structure of SmeT and analyze its interactions with its cognate operator. Like other members of the TetR family of transcriptional repressors, SmeT behaves as a dimer and presents some common structural features with other TetR proteins like TtgR, QacR, and TetR. Differing from other TetR proteins for which the structure is available, SmeT turned out to have two extensions at the N and C termini that might be relevant for its function. Besides, SmeT presents the smallest binding pocket so far described in the TetR family of transcriptional repressors, which may correlate with a specific type and range of effectors. In vitro studies revealed that SmeT binds to a 28-bp pseudopalindromic region, forming two complexes. This operator region was found to overlap the promoters of smeT and smeDEF. This finding is consistent with a role for SmeT simultaneously down-regulating smeT and smeDEF transcription, likely by steric hindrance on RNA polymerase binding to DNA.},

abstract = {An important task of the clinical microbiology laboratory is the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of significant bacterial isolates. The goals of testing are to detect possible drug resistance in common pathogens and to assure susceptibility to drugs of choice for particular infections. The most widely used testing methods include broth microdilution or rapid automated instrument methods that use commercially marketed materials and devices. Manual methods that provide flexibility and possible cost savings include the disk diffusion and gradient diffusion methods. Each method has strengths and weaknesses, including organisms that may be accurately tested by the method. Some methods provide quantitative results (eg, minimum inhibitory concentration), and all provide qualitative assessments using the categories susceptible, intermediate, or resistant. In general, current testing methods provide accurate detection of common antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. However, newer or emerging mechanisms of resistance require constant vigilance regarding the ability of each test method to accurately detect resistance.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Develop a problem-orientated and data-based decision support system (DSS) to improve empirical antibiotic treatment, and compare the performance of the system to that of the physician. DESIGN: The DSS was tested in a prospective, noninterventional, comparative cohort study. SETTING: University hospital in Israel. SUBJECTS: Consecutive patients (n = 496) in four departments of internal medicine suspected of harboring a moderate to severe bacterial infection. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The percentage of appropriate empirical antibiotic treatments. RESULTS: Out of 496 patients included in the study, 219 had positive cultures or serological tests. The physicians prescribed inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment in 91 of 219 patients (42{\%}); whilst the recommendations of the system were inappropriate in 50 patients (23{\%}) (P {\textless} 0.05). Superfluous treatment was prescribed in 15{\%} of patients by the physician, and in 11{\%} by the system. Out of the 91 patients given inappropriate treatment by the physician, the DSS advised treatment to which the pathogens were susceptible in 61 patients. The advantage of the DSS over the physician was most evident in multiresistant gram-negative isolates, enterococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Out of the 277 patients with negative cultures, the DSS advised narrower-spectrum antibiotic treatment than prescribed by the physicians in 27{\%} of patients, and broader-spectrum in 13{\%}. CONCLUSION: A problem-orientated, data-based DSS outperformed physicians in the choice of appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment, and recommended less broad-spectrum antibiotics.},

abstract = {In this study, we developed an integrated hospital-associated urinary tract infection (HAUTI) surveillance information system (called iHAUTISIS) based on existing electronic medical records (EMR) systems for improving the work efficiency of infection control professionals (ICPs) in a 730-bed, tertiary-care teaching hospital in Taiwan. The iHAUTISIS can automatically collect data relevant to HAUTI surveillance from the different EMR systems, and provides a visualization dashboard that helps ICPs make better surveillance plans and facilitates their surveillance work. In order to measure the system performance, we also created a generic model for comparing the ICPs' work efficiency when using existing electronic culture-based surveillance information system (eCBSIS) and iHAUTISIS, respectively. This model can demonstrate a patient's state (unsuspected, suspected, and confirmed) and corresponding time spent on surveillance tasks performed by ICPs for the patient in that state. The study results showed that the iHAUTISIS performed better than the eCBSIS in terms of ICPs' time cost. It reduced the time by 73.27 s, when using iHAUTISIS (114.26 s) and eCBSIS (187.53 s), for each patient on average. With increased adoption of EMR systems, the development of the integrated HAI surveillance information systems would be more and more cost-effective. Moreover, the iHAUTISIS adopted web-based technology that enables ICPs to online access patient's surveillance information using laptops or mobile devices. Therefore, our system can further facilitate the HAI surveillance and reduce ICPs' surveillance workloads.},

abstract = {Genotypic HIV-1 drug resistance testing with standard Sanger sequencing is limited to the detection of mutations with {\textgreater}20{\%} prevalence. A new protocol for variant detection of protease and reverse transcriptase genes of HIV-1 genotype B samples with ultra-deep sequencing on the GS-FLX sequencer (Roche 454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT) was evaluated. The new technology was compared with the standard Sanger sequencing method. For accuracy testing, genotype B samples obtained from proficiency panels were examined with ultra-deep sequencing. Reproducibility was determined by repeat GS-FLX sequencing of 21 clinical samples. Clinical performance was evaluated with 44 samples and the results were compared to the TRUGENE HIV-1 Genotyping Kit (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY). Sequences generated with both protocols were analyzed using the Stanford University HIV drug resistance database. When accuracy was tested, 316 of 317 mutation codons included in the analysis of proficiency panels could be identified correctly with ultra-deep sequencing. Reproducibility testing resulted in a correlation value of R 2=0.969. Analysis of 44 routine clinical samples with the Stanford University HIV drug resistance database revealed a total number of 269 and 171 mutations by the ultra-deep and standard Sanger sequencing, respectively. Drug resistance interpretations showed differences for 11 samples. With ultra-deep sequencing, total time to result was four times longer in comparison to standard Sanger sequencing. Manual work was increased significantly using the new protocol. The ultra-deep sequencing protocol showed good accuracy and reproducibility. However, automation and shorter time to obtain results are essential for use in the routine diagnostic laboratory. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

By using a large administrative database of hospitalized patients with C. diff (by ICD-9 code or cytotoxic assay), this study found that the sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values of ICD-9 coding were 71{\%}, 99{\%}, 87{\%}, and 96{\%} respectively (using micro data as the gold standard). When only using symptomatic patients the sensitivity increased to 82{\%} and when only using symptomatic patients whose test results were available at discharge, the sensitivity increased to 88{\%}.

Additionally, 81.8{\%} of the Vitek 2 results agreed with the known antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. CONCLUSION Vitek 2 correctly identified the commonly isolated strains; however, the limitations of the method may lead to ambiguous findings.},

With the increased adoption and evolution of electronic medical records (EMRs), there is a need to assimilate the tools of ASPs into EMRs, using decision support and feedback. Third-party software vendors provide the mainstay for integration of individual institutional EMR and ASP efforts. Epic is the leading implementer of EMR technology in the United States. A collaboration of physicians and pharmacists are working closely with Epic to provide a more comprehensive platform of ASP tools that may be institutionally individualized. We review the historical relationship between ASPs and the EMR, cite examples of Epic stewardship tools from 3 academic medical centers' ASPs, discuss limitations of these Epic tools, and conclude with the current process in evolution to integrate ASP tools and decision support capacities directly into Epic's EMR.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Deep-sequencing methods are rapidly developing in the field of B-cell receptor (BCR) and T-cell receptor (TCR) diversity. These promise to revolutionise our understanding of adaptive immune dynamics, identify novel antibodies, and allow monitoring of minimal residual disease. However, different methods for BCR and TCR enrichment and amplification have been proposed. Here we perform the first systematic comparison between different methods of enrichment, amplification and sequencing for generating BCR and TCR repertoires using large sample numbers. RESULTS: Resampling from the same RNA or cDNA pool results in highly correlated and reproducible repertoires, but resampling low frequency clones leads to stochastic variance. Repertoires generated by different sequencing methods (454 Roche and Illumina MiSeq) and amplification methods (multiplex PCR, 5' Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5'RACE), and RNA-capture) are highly correlated, and resulting IgHV gene frequencies between the different methods were not significantly different. Read length has an impact on captured repertoire structure, and ultimately full-length BCR sequences are most informative for repertoire analysis as diversity outside of the CDR is very useful for phylogenetic analysis. Additionally, we show RNA-based BCR repertoires are more informative than using DNA. CONCLUSIONS: Repertoires generated by different sequencing and amplification methods are consistent, but we show that read lengths, depths and error profiles should be considered in experimental design, and multiple sampling approaches could be employed to minimise stochastic sampling variation. This detailed investigation of immune repertoire sequencing methods is essential for informing basic and clinical research.},

abstract = {Aging involves a progressive physiological remodeling that is controlled by both genetic and environmental factors. Many of these factors impact also on white adipose tissue (WAT), which has been shown to be a determinant of lifespan. Interrogating a transcriptional network for predicted causal regulatory interactions in a collection of mouse WAT from F2 crosses with a seed set of 60 known longevity genes, we identified a novel transcriptional subnetwork of 742 genes which represent thus-far-unknown longevity genes. Within this subnetwork, one gene was Pparg (Nr1c3), an adipose-enriched nuclear receptor previously not associated with longevity. In silico, both the PPAR signaling pathway and the transcriptional signature of Ppargamma agonist rosiglitazone overlapped with the longevity subnetwork, while in vivo, lowered expression of Pparg reduced lifespan in both the lipodystrophic Pparg1/2-hypomorphic and the Pparg2-deficient mice. These results establish Ppargamma2 as one of the determinants of longevity and suggest that lifespan may be rather determined by a purposeful genetic program than a random process.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Dengue shock syndrome (DSS), a severe life-threatening form of dengue infection, mostly occurs in children. A recent genome wide association study (GWAS) identified two SNPs, rs3132468 of major histocompatibility complex class I polypeptide-related sequence B (MICB) and rs3765524 of phospholipase C, epsilon 1 (PLCE1), associated with DSS in Vietnamese children. In this study, to examine whether an identical association is found in a different population, the association of these two SNPs with DSS was assessed in Thai children with dengue.

METHODS:The rs3132468 and rs3765524 SNPs were genotyped in 917 Thai children with dengue: 76 patients with DSS and 841 patients with non-DSS. The allele frequencies were compared between DSS and non-DSS groups by one-sided Fisher's exact test. The association of rs3132468 and rs3765524 with the mRNA expression levels of MICB and PLCE1 were assessed in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines.

RESULTS:The reported DSS-risk alleles were significantly associated with DSS in Thai patients with dengue (one-sided P = 0.0213 and odds ratio [OR] = 1.58 for rs3132468-C and one-sided P = 0.0252 and OR = 1.49 for rs3765524-C). The rs3132468-C allele showed a significant association with lower mRNA level of MICB (P = 0.0267), whereas the rs3765524-C allele did not. These results imply that the MICB molecule may play an important role in the prevention of DSS in dengue infection.

CONCLUSIONS:Together with previous association studies, we conclude that rs3132468-C at MICB and rs3765524-C at PLCE1 confer risk of DSS in Southeast Asians.},

Both H0N2 and H2N1 recombinants replicated in the brain (in contrast to the H2N2 parent) and both produced lethal effects in CPA-treated animals. Therefore we conclude that A/NWS (H0N1) neurovirulence is not exclusively linked with either the hemagglutinin or the neuraminidase of the virus. The H0N2 and H2N1 recombinants have revealed the existence of two separate attributes of neurovirulence: (i) the capacity of virus to initiate intracerebral infection and (ii) the capacity of infection, once initiated, to produce lethal disease. These studies provide further evidence for the polygenic nature of A/NWS neurovirulence.},

abstract = {Rapid and accurate detection of antibiotic resistance in pathogens is an urgent need, affecting both patient care and population-scale control. Microbial genome sequencing promises much, but many barriers exist to its routine deployment. Here, we address these challenges, using a de Bruijn graph comparison of clinical isolate and curated knowledge-base to identify species and predict resistance profile, including minor populations. This is implemented in a package, Mykrobe predictor, for S. aureus and M. tuberculosis, running in under three minutes on a laptop from raw data. For S. aureus, we train and validate in 495/471 samples respectively, finding error rates comparable to gold-standard phenotypic methods, with sensitivity/specificity of 99.3{\%}/99.5{\%} across 12 drugs. For M. tuberculosis, we identify species and predict resistance with specificity of 98.5{\%} (training/validating on 1920/1609 samples). Sensitivity of 82.6{\%} is limited by current understanding of genetic mechanisms. We also show that analysis of minor populations increases power to detect phenotypic resistance in second-line drugs without appreciable loss of specificity. Finally, we demonstrate feasibility of an emerging single-molecule sequencing technique.},

abstract = {Treating messenger RNA transcript abundances as quantitative traits and mapping gene expression quantitative trait loci for these traits has been pursued in gene-specific ways. Transcript abundances often serve as a surrogate for classical quantitative traits in that the levels of expression are significantly correlated with the classical traits across members of a segregating population. The correlation structure between transcript abundances and classical traits has been used to identify susceptibility loci for complex diseases such as diabetes and allergic asthma. One study recently completed the first comprehensive dissection of transcriptional regulation in budding yeast, giving a detailed glimpse of a genome-wide survey of the genetics of gene expression. Unlike classical quantitative traits, which often represent gross clinical measurements that may be far removed from the biological processes giving rise to them, the genetic linkages associated with transcript abundance affords a closer look at cellular biochemical processes. Here we describe comprehensive genetic screens of mouse, plant and human transcriptomes by considering gene expression values as quantitative traits. We identify a gene expression pattern strongly associated with obesity in a murine cross, and observe two distinct obesity subtypes. Furthermore, we find that these obesity subtypes are under the control of different loci.},

abstract = {The pathogen-host interaction database (PHI-base) is a web-accessible database that catalogues experimentally verified pathogenicity, virulence and effector genes from bacterial, fungal and Oomycete pathogens, which infect human, animal, plant, insect, fish and fungal hosts. Plant endophytes are also included. PHI-base is therefore an invaluable resource for the discovery of genes in medically and agronomically important pathogens, which may be potential targets for chemical intervention. The database is freely accessible to both academic and non-academic users. This publication describes recent additions to the database and both current and future applications. The number of fields that characterize PHI-base entries has almost doubled. Important additional fields deal with new experimental methods, strain information, pathogenicity islands and external references that link the database to external resources, for example, gene ontology terms and Locus IDs. Another important addition is the inclusion of anti-infectives and their target genes that makes it possible to predict the compounds, that may interact with newly identified virulence factors. In parallel, the curation process has been improved and now involves several external experts. On the technical side, several new search tools have been provided and the database is also now distributed in XML format. PHI-base is available at: http://www.phi-base.org/.},

Originally thought to trigger a disease of only mild symptoms, recently Chikungunya virus caused large-scale fatalities and widespread economic loss that was linked to recent virus genetic mutation and evolution. Due to the paucity of information on Chikungunya immunological progression, we investigated the serum levels of 13 cytokines/chemokines during the acute phase of Chikungunya disease and 6- and 12-month post-infection follow-up from patients of the Italian outbreak. We found that CXCL9/MIG, CCL2/MCP-1, IL-6 and CXCL10/IP-10 were significantly raised in the acute phase compared to follow-up samples. Furthermore, IL-1$\beta$, TNF-$\alpha$, Il-12, IL-10, IFN-$\gamma$ and IL-5 had low initial acute phase levels that significantly increased at later time points. Analysis of symptom severity showed association with CXCL9/MIG, CXCL10/IP-10 and IgG levels. These data give insight into Chikungunya disease establishment and subsequent convalescence, which is imperative to the treatment and containment of this quickly evolving and frequently re-emerging disease.},

abstract = {Early studies that explored host-pathogen interactions assumed that infected individuals within a population have equal chances of transmitting the infection to others. Subsequently, in what became known as the 20/80 rule, a small percentage of individuals within any population was observed to control most transmission events. This empirical rule was shown to govern inter-individual transmission dynamics for many pathogens in several species, and individuals who infect disproportionately more secondary contacts, as compared to most others, became known as super-spreaders. Studies conducted in the wake of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic revealed that, in the absence of super-spreading events, most individuals infect few, if any, secondary contacts. The analysis of SARS transmission, and reports from other outbreaks, unveil a complex scenario in which super-spreading events are shaped by multiple factors, including co-infection with another pathogen, immune suppression, changes in airflow dynamics, delayed hospital admission, misdiagnosis, and inter-hospital transfers. Predicting and identifying super-spreaders open significant medical and public health challenges, and represent important facets of infectious disease management and pandemic preparedness plans. ?? 2011.},

abstract = {The 1918 influenza A H1N1 virus caused the worst pandemic of influenza ever recorded. To better understand the pathogenesis and immunity to the 1918 pandemic virus, we generated recombinant influenza viruses possessing two to five genes of the 1918 influenza virus. Recombinant influenza viruses possessing the hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), matrix (M), nonstructural (NS), and nucleoprotein (NP) genes or any recombinant virus possessing both the HA and NA genes of the 1918 influenza virus were highly lethal for mice. Antigenic analysis by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests with ferret and chicken H1N1 antisera demonstrated that the 1918 recombinant viruses antigenically most resembled A/Swine/Iowa/30 (Sw/Iowa/30) virus but differed from H1N1 viruses isolated since 1930. HI and virus neutralizing (VN) antibodies to 1918 recombinant and Sw/Iowa/30 viruses in human sera were present among individuals born before or shortly after the 1918 pandemic. Mice that received an intramuscular immunization of the homologous or Sw/Iowa/30-inactivated vaccine developed HI and VN antibodies to the 1918 recombinant virus and were completely protected against lethal challenge. Mice that received A/PR/8/34, A/Texas/36/91, or A/New Caledonia/20/99 H1N1 vaccines displayed partial protection from lethal challenge. In contrast, control-vaccinated mice were not protected against lethal challenge and displayed high virus titers in respiratory tissues. Partial vaccine protection mediated by baculovirus-expressed recombinant HA vaccines suggest common cross-reactive epitopes on the H1 HA. These data suggest a strategy of vaccination that would be effective against a reemergent 1918 or 1918-like virus.},

abstract = {In 2004, the SEED (http://pubseed.theseed.org/) was created to provide consistent and accurate genome annotations across thousands of genomes and as a platform for discovering and developing de novo annotations. The SEED is a constantly updated integration of genomic data with a genome database, web front end, API and server scripts. It is used by many scientists for predicting gene functions and discovering new pathways. In addition to being a powerful database for bioinformatics research, the SEED also houses subsystems (collections of functionally related protein families) and their derived FIGfams (protein families), which represent the core of the RAST annotation engine (http://rast.nmpdr.org/). When a new genome is submitted to RAST, genes are called and their annotations are made by comparison to the FIGfam collection. If the genome is made public, it is then housed within the SEED and its proteins populate the FIGfam collection. This annotation cycle has proven to be a robust and scalable solution to the problem of annotating the exponentially increasing number of genomes. To date, {\textgreater}12 000 users worldwide have annotated {\textgreater}60 000 distinct genomes using RAST. Here we describe the interconnectedness of the SEED database and RAST, the RAST annotation pipeline and updates to both resources.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND With the decrease of DNA sequencing costs, sequence-based typing methods are rapidly becoming the gold standard for epidemiological surveillance. These methods provide reproducible and comparable results needed for a global scale bacterial population analysis, while retaining their usefulness for local epidemiological surveys. Online databases that collect the generated allelic profiles and associated epidemiological data are available but this wealth of data remains underused and are frequently poorly annotated since no user-friendly tool exists to analyze and explore it. RESULTS PHYLOViZ is platform independent Java software that allows the integrated analysis of sequence-based typing methods, including SNP data generated from whole genome sequence approaches, and associated epidemiological data. goeBURST and its Minimum Spanning Tree expansion are used for visualizing the possible evolutionary relationships between isolates. The results can be displayed as an annotated graph overlaying the query results of any other epidemiological data available.

abstract = {Between-sample variation in high-throughput flow cytometry data poses a significant challenge for analysis of large-scale data sets, such as those derived from multicenter clinical trials. It is often hard to match biologically relevant cell populations across samples because of technical variation in sample acquisition and instrumentation differences. Thus, normalization of data is a critical step before analysis, particularly in large-scale data sets from clinical trials, where group-specific differences may be subtle and patient-to-patient variation common. We have developed two normalization methods that remove technical between-sample variation by aligning prominent features (landmarks) in the raw data on a per-channel basis. These algorithms were tested on two independent flow cytometry data sets by comparing manually gated data, either individually for each sample or using static gating templates, before and after normalization. Our results show a marked improvement in the overlap between manual and static gating when the data are normalized, thereby facilitating the use of automated analyses on large flow cytometry data sets. Such automated analyses are essential for high-throughput flow cytometry.},

Both ca and DNA-rAd vaccinations induced antibody and T cell responses, and protected against lethal H1N1 challenge. Only A/NP+M2 DNA-rAd protected against challenge with highly pathogenic A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1); ca vaccine did not.

This study investigated the association between mutations in these genes in influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and the risk of severe or fatal disease. Searches were conducted on the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science electronic databases and the reference lists of published studies. The PRISMA and STROBE guidelines were followed in assessing the quality of studies and writing-up. Eighteen (18) studies, from all continents, were included in the systematic review (recruiting patients 0 - 77 years old). The mutation D222G was associated with a significant increase in severe disease (pooled RD: 11 {\%}, 95 {\%} CI: 3.0 {\%} - 18.0 {\%}, p = 0.004) and the risk of fatality (RD: 23 {\%}, 95 {\%} CI: 14.0 {\%}-31.0 {\%}, p = {\textless} 0.0001). No association was observed between the mutations HA-D222N, D222E, PB2-E627K and NS1-T123V and severe/fatal disease. The results suggest that no virus quasispecies bearing virulence-conferring mutations in the HA, PB2 and NS1 predominated. However issues of sampling bias, and bias due to uncontrolled confounders such as comorbidities, and viral and bacterial coinfection, should be born in mind. Influenza A viruses should continue to be monitored for the occurrence of virulence-conferring mutations in HA, PB2 and NS1. There are suggestions that respiratory virus coinfections also affect virus virulence. Studies investigating the role of genetic mutations on disease outcome should make efforts to also investigate the role of respiratory virus coinfections.},

abstract = {Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthritogenic mosquito-transmitted alphavirus that is undergoing reemergence in areas around the Indian Ocean. Despite the current and potential danger posed by this virus, we know surprisingly little about the induction and evasion of CHIKV-associated antiviral immune responses. With this in mind we investigated innate immune reactions to CHIKV in human fibroblasts, a demonstrable in vivo target of virus replication and spread. We show that CHIKV infection leads to activation of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and subsequent transcription of IRF3-dependent antiviral genes, including beta interferon (IFN-$\beta$). IRF3 activation occurs by way of a virus-induced innate immune signaling pathway that includes the adaptor molecule interferon promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1). Despite strong transcriptional upregulation of these genes, however, translation of the corresponding proteins is not observed. We further demonstrate that translation of cellular (but not viral) genes is blocked during infection and that although CHIKV is found to trigger inactivation of the translational molecule eukaryotic initiation factor subunit 2$\alpha$ by way of the double-stranded RNA sensor protein kinase R, this response is not required for the block to protein synthesis. Furthermore, overall diminution of cellular RNA synthesis is also observed in the presence of CHIKV and transcription of IRF3-dependent antiviral genes appears specifically blocked late in infection. We hypothesize that the observed absence of IFN-$\beta$ and antiviral proteins during infection results from an evasion mechanism exhibited by CHIKV that is dependent on widespread shutoff of cellular protein synthesis and a targeted block to late synthesis of antiviral mRNA transcripts.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a common and sometimes fatal health-care-associated infection; the incidence, deaths, and excess health-care costs resulting from CDIs in hospitalized patients are all at historic highs. Meanwhile, the contribution of nonhospital health-care exposures to the overall burden of CDI, and the ability of programs to prevent CDIs by implementing CDC recommendations across a range of hospitals, have not been demonstrated previously. METHODS: Population-based data from the Emerging Infections Program were analyzed by location and antecedent health-care exposures. Present-on-admission and hospital-onset, laboratory-identified CDIs reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) were analyzed. Rates of hospital-onset CDIs were compared between two 8-month periods near the beginning and end of three CDI prevention programs that focused primarily on measures to prevent intrahospital transmission of C. difficile in three states (Illinois, Massachusetts, and New York). RESULTS: Among CDIs identified in Emerging Infections Program data in 2010, 94{\%} were associated with receiving health care; of these, 75{\%} had onset among persons not currently hospitalized, including recently discharged patients, outpatients, and nursing home residents. Among CDIs reported to NHSN in 2010, 52{\%} were already present on hospital admission, although they were largely health-care related. The pooled CDI rate declined 20{\%} among 71 hospitals participating in the CDI prevention programs. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly all CDIs are related to various health-care settings where predisposing antibiotics are prescribed and C. difficile transmission occurs. Hospital-onset CDIs were prevented through an emphasis on infection control. IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH: More needs to be done to prevent CDIs; major reductions will require antibiotic stewardship along with infection control applied to nursing homes and ambulatory-care settings as well as hospitals. State health departments and partner organizations have shown leadership in preventing CDIs in hospitals and can prevent more CDIs by extending their programs to cover other health-care settings.},

More limited epidemics initiated by travelers subsequently occurred in Italy and France, as well as human cases exported to most regions of the world, including the Americas where CHIKV could become endemic. Because CHIKV circulates during epidemics in an urban mosquito-human cycle, control of transmission relies on mosquito abatement, which is rarely effective. Furthermore, there is no antiviral treatment for CHIKV infection and no licensed vaccine to prevent disease.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: NDM-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae represent a major clinical and infection control challenge, particularly in resource-limited settings with high rates of antimicrobial resistance. Determining whether transmission occurs at a gene, plasmid or bacterial strain level, within hospital and/or the community, has implications for monitoring and controlling spread. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is the highest-resolution typing method available for transmission epidemiology. METHODS: We sequenced carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates from 26 individuals involved in several infection case clusters in a Nepali neonatal unit, and 68 other clinical Gram-negative isolates from a similar timeframe, using Illumina and PacBio technologies. Within-outbreak chromosomal and closed plasmid structures were generated, and used as dataset-specific references. RESULTS: Three temporally separated case clusters were caused by a single NDM-K. pneumoniae strain, with a conserved set of four plasmids, one being a 304,526bp blaNDM-1-plasmid. The plasmids contained a large number of antimicrobial/heavy metal resistance and plasmid maintenance genes, which may have explained persistence. No obvious environmental/human reservoir was found. There was no evidence of transmission of outbreak plasmids to other Gram-negative clinical isolates, although blaNDM variants were present in other isolates in different genetic contexts. CONCLUSIONS: WGS can effectively define complex antimicrobial resistance epidemiology. Wider sampling frames are required to contextualize outbreaks. Infection control may be effective in terminating outbreaks caused by particular strains, even in areas with widespread resistance, although this study could not demonstrate evidence supporting specific interventions. Larger, detailed studies are needed to characterize resistance genes, vectors and host strains involved in disease, to enable effective intervention.},

Current typing technologies have been useful in revealing relationships between isolates of A. baumannii but they are unable to resolve differences between closely related isolates from small-scale outbreaks, where chains of transmission are often unclear. In a recent hospital outbreak in Birmingham, six patients were colonised with MDR-Aci isolates indistinguishable using standard techniques. We used whole-genome sequencing to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms in these isolates, allowing us to discriminate between alternative epidemiological hypotheses in this setting.},

@article{Chung2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA-Seq technology measures the transcript abundance by generating sequence reads and counting their frequencies across different biological conditions. To identify differentially expressed genes between two conditions, it is important to consider the experimental design as well as the distributional property of the data. In many RNA-Seq studies, the expression data are obtained as multiple pairs, e.g., pre- vs. post-treatment samples from the same individual. We seek to incorporate paired structure into analysis.

RESULTS: We present a Bayesian hierarchical mixture model for RNA-Seq data to separately account for the variability within and between individuals from a paired data structure. The method assumes a Poisson distribution for the data mixed with a gamma distribution to account variability between pairs. The effect of differential expression is modeled by two-component mixture model. The performance of this approach is examined by simulated and real data.

CONCLUSIONS: In this setting, our proposed model provides higher sensitivity than existing methods to detect differential expression. Application to real RNA-Seq data demonstrates the usefulness of this method for detecting expression alteration for genes with low average expression levels or shorter transcript length.},

abstract = {CONTEXT:Studies with positive results are more likely to be published in biomedical journals than are studies with negative results. However, many studies submitted for consideration at scientific meetings are never published in full; bias in this setting is poorly studied.

OBJECTIVE:To identify features associated with the fate of research abstracts submitted to a scientific meeting.

DESIGN AND SETTING:Prospective observational cohort, with 5-year follow-up of all research submitted for consideration to the major annual 1991 US research meeting in the specialty of emergency medicine.

PARTICIPANTS:All research abstracts submitted for consideration at the meeting for possible presentation.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:Characteristics associated with acceptance for presentation at the meeting and subsequent publication as a full manuscript.

RESULTS:A total of 492 research abstracts were submitted from programs in emergency medicine and other specialties affiliated with 103 US medical schools. A total of 179 (36{\%}) were accepted for presentation and 214 (43{\%}) were published in 44 journals. Of the 179 abstracts accepted for presentation, 111 studies were published. Scientific quality of abstracts or prestige of the journal in which the study was eventually published did not predict either of these outcomes. The best predictors (by logistic regression) of meeting acceptance were a subjective "originality" factor (odds ratio [OR], 2.07; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.13-3.89) and positive results (OR, 1.99; 95{\%} CI, 1.07-3.84), and, for publication, meeting acceptance (OR, 2.49; 95{\%} CI, 1.49-4.35) and large sample size (OR, 2.26; 95{\%} CI, 1.23-4.31). Forty-nine percent (241) of abstracts did not report on blinding, and 24{\%} (118) did not report on randomization. Acceptance and publication were both more likely for positive outcomes (P=.03). Funnel plots showed the classic distribution of positive-outcome ("publication") bias at each of the submission, acceptance, and publication phases. Meeting acceptance predicted publication with a sensitivity of only 51{\%}, specificity of 71{\%}, positive predictive value of 57{\%}, and negative predictive value of 66{\%}.

CONCLUSIONS:Positive-outcome bias was evident when studies were submitted for consideration and was amplified in the selection of abstracts for both presentation and publication, neither of which was strongly related to study design or quality.},

abstract = {Bacteria producing Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs) are rapidly emerging as a cause of multidrug-resistant infections worldwide. Bacterial isolates harbouring these enzymes are capable of hydrolysing a broad spectrum of beta-lactams including the penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems and monobactam. Detection of isolates harbouring carbapenemases can be inconsistent using automated systems, often requiring subsequent confirmatory tests. Phenotypic methods utilizing boronic acid disc tests have demonstrated promising results and appear practical for use in clinical microbiology laboratories. Treatment of infection caused by KPC bacteria is particularly worrisome as the carbapenems are often agents of the last resort for resistant Gram-negative infections. The optimal treatment of infections caused by KPC bacteria is not well established and clinical outcome data remain sparse. We reviewed the current literature regarding clinical outcomes following KPC infections, with a specific effort to summarize the clinical data available for specific antimicrobial agents. A total of 15 papers involving 55 unique patient cases were reviewed. While the total number of patients is relatively small, some useful insights could still be gathered to guide clinicians in the management of KPC infections. Tigecycline and the aminoglycosides were associated with positive outcomes in the majority of cases. Clinical success rates were low when the polymyxins were used as monotherapy, but were much higher when they were used in combination. Studies examining combination therapy and well-controlled clinical trials are needed to ascertain the optimal treatment of infections caused by KPC bacteria.},

@article{Check2014,
abstract = {A good first shot, but not a game-changer — yet. That seems to be the consensus among scientists after today's first public release of data produced by the MinION, an advanced and highly anticipated DNA-sequencing device developed by UK company Oxford Nanopore Technologies. The MinION is not yet for sale. But David Jaffe, a computational biologist at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, used data produced by the device and provided by Oxford Nanopore to aid in the assembly of two bacterial genomes — those of Escherichia coli and a bacterium from the genus Scardovia that is found in the human mouth. He presented his results today at the Advances in Genome Biology and Technology meeting in Marco Island, Florida. “It's kind of a cute device,” says Jaffe of the MinION, which is roughly the size and shape of a packet of chewing gum. “It has pretty lights and a fan that hums pleasantly, and plugs into a USB drive.” But his technical review is mixed. Refining reads The average length of the sequences generated on the MinION is 5.4 kilobases, with some as long as 10 kilobases. That is longer than the average read out delivered by the current dominant sequencing technology, sold by Illumina of San Diego, California, which delivers fragments of DNA that are hundreds of base pairs long. But the median length of the MinION's reads is shorter than the target that Oxford Nanopore announced in 2012. Jaffe also found that the MinION seemed to have difficulty sequencing particular parts of the bacterial genomes that he studied. That is worrisome to bioinformaticians, because it is more challenging to correct for systematic sequencing errors than random ones. In Jaffe's case, the recurring errors prevented him from assembling the complete genome sequences of the two bacteria from scratch using only MinION data; instead, he used MinION sequences to supplement data generated by Illumina machines. But he sounded optimistic about the MinION's future. Oxford Nanopore has said that higher-quality DNA or different preparation methods should increase the average read length. Jaffe says that the company can work to eliminate errors, perhaps by using a variety of pores with different properties. But even now, he says, most long MinION reads had lengthy stretches without any mistakes. The systematic errors are “a temporary feature that we hope they'll figure out how to solve”. Early days Other researchers will soon have a chance to form their own opinions about the device, as Oxford Nanopore today launched its early-access programme. Researchers who pay a US{\$}1,000 deposit, plus {\$}250 for shipping costs, can receive their own MinIONs to begin testing the machines in their labs. But Isaac Ro, an analyst at US investment bank Goldman Sachs — which advised Illumina in 2012 when it fought off a takeover bid by the Swiss drug giant Roche — called Jaffe's presentation “underwhelming”. “Oxford Nanopore still appears to be in development mode and, in our view, is unlikely to threaten [Illumina's] competitive position at this time,” Ro said in a research note. However, some scientists think that the MinION has potential to shake up the sequencing industry. Geneticist Yaniv Erlich of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts, says that the small, cheap and portable MinION is a welcome change from the bulky, pricey sequencing machines that scientists are used to. If Oxford Nanopore continues to improve the technology, he says, it will enable a range of applications that are not possible today, such as the use of sequencers outside the lab. “This reminds me of the early days of Illumina, when all we could get were 36-base-pair reads, and we were all very excited about that,” says Erlich. “I think we should give [Oxford Nanopore] more time.” Nature doi:10.1038/nature.2014.14724},

The variation in biological context, and the increasingly dispersed mode of data generation, imply a need for precise, interoperable and flexible representations of genomic features through formats that are easy to parse. A host of alternative formats are currently available and in use, complicating analysis and tool development. The issue of whether and how the multitude of formats reflects varying underlying characteristics of data has to our knowledge not previously been systematically treated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We here identify intrinsic distinctions between genomic features, and argue that the distinctions imply that a certain variation in the representation of features as genomic tracks is warranted. Four core informational properties of tracks are discussed: gaps, lengths, values and interconnections. From this we delineate fifteen generic track types. Based on the track type distinctions, we characterize major existing representational formats and find that the track types are not adequately supported by any single format. We also find, in contrast to the XML formats, that none of the existing tabular formats are conveniently extendable to support all track types. We thus propose two unified formats for track data, an improved XML format, BioXSD 1.1, and a new tabular format, GTrack 1.0.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The defined track types are shown to capture relevant distinctions between genomic annotation tracks, resulting in varying representational needs and analysis possibilities. The proposed formats, GTrack 1.0 and BioXSD 1.1, cater to the identified track distinctions and emphasize preciseness, flexibility and parsing convenience.},

abstract = {Background Health care-associated infections (HAIs) are the most common noncardiac complications after cardiac surgery and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Current information about their economic burden is limited.
Objectives This research was designed to determine the cost associated with major types of HAIs during the first 2 months after cardiac surgery.
Methods Prospectively collected data from a multicenter, observational study of the Cardiothoracic Surgery Clinical Trials Network, in which patients were monitored for infections for 65 days after surgery, were merged with related financial data routinely collected by the University HealthSystem Consortium. Incremental length of stay (LOS) and cost associated with HAIs were estimated using generalized linear models, with adjustments for patient demographics, clinical history, baseline laboratory values, and surgery type.
Results Among 4,320 cardiac surgery patients (mean age: 64 ?? 13 years), 119 (2.8{\%}) experienced a major HAI during the index hospitalization. The most common HAIs were pneumonia (48{\%}), sepsis (20{\%}), and Clostridium difficile colitis (18{\%}). On average, the estimated incremental cost associated with a major HAI was nearly {\$}38,000, of which 47{\%} was related to intensive care unit services. The incremental LOS was 14 days. Overall, there were 849 readmissions; among these, 8.7{\%} were attributed to major HAIs. The cost of readmissions due to major HAIs was, on average, nearly threefold that of readmissions not related to HAIs.
Conclusions Hospital cost, LOS, and readmissions are strongly associated with HAIs. These associations suggest the potential for large reductions in costs if HAIs following cardiac surgery can be reduced. (Management Practices and the Risk of Infections Following Cardiac Surgery; NCT01089712).},

abstract = {Inexact graph matching has been one of the significant research foci in the area of pattern analysis. As an important way to measure the similarity between pairwise graphs error-tolerantly, graph edit distance (GED) is the base of inexact graph matching. The research advance of GED is surveyed in order to provide a review of the existing literatures and offer some insights into the studies of GED. Since graphs may be attributed or non-attributed and the definition of costs for edit operations is various, the existing GED algorithms are categorized according to these two factors and described in detail. After these algorithms are analyzed and their limitations are identified, several promising directions for further research are proposed.},

abstract = {Individuals with unknown HIV status are at risk for undiagnosed HIV, but practical and reliable methods for identifying these individuals have not been described. We developed an algorithm to identify patients with unknown HIV status using data from the electronic medical record (EMR) of a large health care system. We developed EMR-based criteria to classify patients as having known status (HIV-positive or HIV-negative) or unknown status and applied these criteria to all patients seen in the affiliated health care system from 2008 to 2012. Performance characteristics of the algorithm for identifying patients with unknown HIV status were calculated by comparing a random sample of the algorithm's results to a reference standard medical record review. The algorithm classifies all patients as having either known or unknown HIV status. Its sensitivity and specificity for identifying patients with unknown status are 99.4{\%} (95{\%} CI: 96.5-100{\%}) and 95.2{\%} (95{\%} CI: 83.8-99.4{\%}), respectively, with positive and negative predictive values of 98.7{\%} (95{\%} CI: 95.5-99.8{\%}) and 97.6{\%} (95{\%} CI: 87.1-99.1{\%}), respectively. Using commonly available data from an EMR, our algorithm has high sensitivity and specificity for identifying patients with unknown HIV status. This algorithm may inform expanded HIV testing strategies aiming to test the untested.},

abstract = {We introduce a technique to filter out complex data sets by extracting a subgraph of representative links. Such a filtering can be tuned up to any desired level by controlling the genus of the resulting graph. We show that this technique is especially suitable for correlation-based graphs, giving filtered graphs that preserve the hierarchical organization of the minimum spanning tree but containing a larger amount of information in their internal structure. In particular in the case of planar filtered graphs (genus equal to 0), triangular loops and four-element cliques are formed. The application of this filtering procedure to 100 stocks in the U.S. equity markets shows that such loops and cliques have important and significant relationships with the market structure and properties.},

abstract = {Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging multidrug-resistant global opportunistic pathogen. The increasing incidence of nosocomial and community-acquired S. maltophilia infections is of particular concern for immunocompromised individuals, as this bacterial pathogen is associated with a significant fatality/case ratio. S. maltophilia is an environmental bacterium found in aqueous habitats, including plant rhizospheres, animals, foods, and water sources. Infections of S. maltophilia can occur in a range of organs and tissues; the organism is commonly found in respiratory tract infections. This review summarizes the current literature and presents S. maltophilia as an organism with various molecular mechanisms used for colonization and infection. S. maltophilia can be recovered from polymicrobial infections, most notably from the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis patients, as a cocolonizer with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Recent evidence of cell-cell communication between these pathogens has implications for the development of novel pharmacological therapies. Animal models of S. maltophilia infection have provided useful information about the type of host immune response induced by this opportunistic pathogen. Current and emerging treatments for patients infected with S. maltophilia are discussed.},

abstract = {Influenza viruses are remarkably adept at surviving in the human population over a long timescale. The human influenza A virus continues to thrive even among populations with widespread access to vaccines, and continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The virus mutates from year to year, making the existing vaccines ineffective on a regular basis, and requiring that new strains be chosen for a new vaccine. Less-frequent major changes, known as antigenic shift, create new strains against which the human population has little protective immunity, thereby causing worldwide pandemics. The most recent pandemics include the 1918 'Spanish' flu, one of the most deadly outbreaks in recorded history, which killed 30-50 million people worldwide, the 1957 'Asian' flu, and the 1968 'Hong Kong' flu. Motivated by the need for a better understanding of influenza evolution, we have developed flexible protocols that make it possible to apply large-scale sequencing techniques to the highly variable influenza genome. Here we report the results of sequencing 209 complete genomes of the human influenza A virus, encompassing a total of 2,821,103 nucleotides. In addition to increasing markedly the number of publicly available, complete influenza virus genomes, we have discovered several anomalies in these first 209 genomes that demonstrate the dynamic nature of influenza transmission and evolution. This new, large-scale sequencing effort promises to provide a more comprehensive picture of the evolution of influenza viruses and of their pattern of transmission through human and animal populations. All data from this project are being deposited, without delay, in public archives.},

abstract = {Alignment quality may have as much impact on phylogenetic reconstruction as the phylogenetic methods used. Not only the alignment algorithm, but also the method used to deal with the most problematic alignment regions, may have a critical effect on the final tree. Although some authors remove such problematic regions, either manually or using automatic methods, in order to improve phylogenetic performance, others prefer to keep such regions to avoid losing any information. Our aim in the present work was to examine whether phylogenetic reconstruction improves after alignment cleaning or not. Using simulated protein alignments with gaps, we tested the relative performance in diverse phylogenetic analyses of the whole alignments versus the alignments with problematic regions removed with our previously developed Gblocks program. We also tested the performance of more or less stringent conditions in the selection of blocks. Alignments constructed with different alignment methods (ClustalW, Mafft, and Probcons) were used to estimate phylogenetic trees by maximum likelihood, neighbor joining, and parsimony. We show that, in most alignment conditions, and for alignments that are not too short, removal of blocks leads to better trees. That is, despite losing some information, there is an increase in the actual phylogenetic signal. Overall, the best trees are obtained by maximum-likelihood reconstruction of alignments cleaned by Gblocks. In general, a relaxed selection of blocks is better for short alignment, whereas a stringent selection is more adequate for longer ones. Finally, we show that cleaned alignments produce better topologies although, paradoxically, with lower bootstrap. This indicates that divergent and problematic alignment regions may lead, when present, to apparently better supported although, in fact, more biased topologies.},

abstract = {Human monocytes are commonly defined and discriminated by the extent of their cell surface expression of CD14 and CD16, with associated differences in function and phenotype related to the intensity of expression of these markers. With increasing interest into the function and behaviour of monocytes, it is important to have a clear understanding of how differing strategies of analysis can affect results and how different protocols and population backgrounds can affect this highly morphogenic cell type.Using PBMCs from populations with differing ethnicities and histories of parasite exposure we have characterized monocyte phenotype based on intensity of CD14 and CD16 expression. Using the surface markers HLA-DR, CCR2 and CX3CR1, we compared monocyte phenotype between populations and further assessed changes in monocytes with freezing and thawing of PBMCs.Our results reveal that there is a progression of surface marker expression based on intensity of CD14 or CD16 expression, stressing the importance of careful gating of monocyte subtypes. Freezing and thawing of the PBMCs has no effect generally on the monocytes, although it does lead to a decrease in CD16 and CX3CR1 expression. We show that there are differences in the monocyte populations based on ethnicity and history of exposure to the common parasites Plasmodium falciparum and Schistosoma haematobium.This study highlights that blood monocytes consist of a continuous population of cells, within which the dominant phenotype may vary dependent on the background of the study population. Comparing results from monocyte studies therefore needs to be done with great care, as ethnic background of donor population, gating strategy and processing of PBMCs may all have an effect on outcome of monocyte phenotype. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The HMS can deal with various IDs: accession numbers of International Nucleotide Sequence Databases, HUGO Gene Symbols and IDs of UniProt, PDB, H-InvDB and others, and it can return URLs of various databases: H-InvDB, HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee Database, NCBI Entrez Gene, UniProt, PDB and others.

Not only the CGI-program, the HMS provides a Web page for finding and opening URLs of these databases. Although hyperlinking is an effective way of relating biological data among different databases, updating hyperlinks has been a laborious work. The HMS fully automates the job, enabling maintenance-free hyperlinks. We also developed the ID Converter System (ICS) for simply converting data IDs by using corresponding tables in the HMS.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Individual researchers are struggling to keep up with the accelerating emergence of high-throughput biological data, and to extract information that relates to their specific questions. Integration of accumulated evidence should permit researchers to form fewer - and more accurate - hypotheses for further study through experimentation.

RESULTS:Here a method previously used to predict Gene Ontology (GO) terms for Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Tian et al.: Combining guilt-by-association and guilt-by-profiling to predict Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene function. Genome Biol 2008, 9(Suppl 1):S7) is applied to predict GO terms and phenotypes for 21,603 Mus musculus genes, using a diverse collection of integrated data sources (including expression, interaction, and sequence-based data). This combined 'guilt-by-profiling' and 'guilt-by-association' approach optimizes the combination of two inference methodologies. Predictions at all levels of confidence are evaluated by examining genes not used in training, and top predictions are examined manually using available literature and knowledge base resources.

CONCLUSION:We assigned a confidence score to each gene/term combination. The results provided high prediction performance, with nearly every GO term achieving greater than 40{\%} precision at 1{\%} recall. Among the 36 novel predictions for GO terms and 40 for phenotypes that were studied manually, {\textgreater}80{\%} and {\textgreater}40{\%}, respectively, were identified as accurate. We also illustrate that a combination of 'guilt-by-profiling' and 'guilt-by-association' outperforms either approach alone in their application to M. musculus.},

abstract = {Dengue virus (DENV) is a pathogen with a high impact on human health. It replicates in a wide range of cells involved in the immune response. To efficiently infect humans, DENV must evade or inhibit fundamental elements of the innate immune system, namely the type I interferon response. DENV circumvents the host immune response by expressing proteins that antagonize the cellular innate immunity. We have recently documented the inhibition of type I IFN production by the proteolytic activity of DENV NS2B3 protease complex in human monocyte derived dendritic cells (MDDCs). In the present report we identify the human adaptor molecule STING as a target of the NS2B3 protease complex. We characterize the mechanism of inhibition of type I IFN production in primary human MDDCs by this viral factor. Using different human and mouse primary cells lacking STING, we show enhanced DENV replication. Conversely, mutated versions of STING that cannot be cleaved by the DENV NS2B3 protease induced higher levels of type I IFN after infection with DENV. Additionally, we show that DENV NS2B3 is not able to degrade the mouse version of STING, a phenomenon that severely restricts the replication of DENV in mouse cells, suggesting that STING plays a key role in the inhibition of DENV infection and spread in mice.},

Here we detail a multistep procedure for identifying potential key drivers of complex traits that integrates DNA-variation and gene-expression data with other complex trait data in segregating mouse populations. Ordering gene expression traits relative to one another and relative to other complex traits is achieved by systematically testing whether variations in DNA that lead to variations in relative transcript abundances statistically support an independent, causative or reactive function relative to the complex traits under consideration. We show that this approach can predict transcriptional responses to single gene-perturbation experiments using gene-expression data in the context of a segregating mouse population. We also demonstrate the utility of this approach by identifying and experimentally validating the involvement of three new genes in susceptibility to obesity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Learning the function of genes is a major goal of computational genomics. Methods for inferring gene function have typically fallen into two categories: 'guilt-by-profiling', which exploits correlation between function and other gene characteristics; and 'guilt-by-association', which transfers function from one gene to another via biological relationships.

RESULTS:We have developed a strategy ('Funckenstein') that performs guilt-by-profiling and guilt-by-association and combines the results. Using a benchmark set of functional categories and input data for protein-coding genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Funckenstein was compared with a previous combined strategy. Subsequently, we applied Funckenstein to 2,455 Gene Ontology terms. In the process, we developed 2,455 guilt-by-profiling classifiers based on 8,848 gene characteristics and 12 functional linkage graphs based on 23 biological relationships.

CONCLUSION:Funckenstein outperforms a previous combined strategy using a common benchmark dataset. The combination of 'guilt-by-profiling' and 'guilt-by-association' gave significant improvement over the component classifiers, showing the greatest synergy for the most specific functions. Performance was evaluated by cross-validation and by literature examination of the top-scoring novel predictions. These quantitative predictions should help prioritize experimental study of yeast gene functions.},

Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n = 100), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (n = 100), Enterococcus spp. (n = 89), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 29), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 66) were examined with the ID-GPC identification card and with the AST-P515 (for staphylococci), AST-P516 (for enterococci and S. agalactiae) and AST-P506 (for pneumococci) susceptibility cards. The identification comparison methods were the API Staph for staphylococci and the API 20 Strep for streptococci and enterococci; for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the agar dilution method according to the procedure of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) was used. The VITEK 2 system correctly identified to the species level (only one choice or after simple supplementary tests) 99{\%} of S. aureus, 96.5{\%} of S. agalactiae, 96.9{\%} of S. pneumoniae, 92.7{\%} of Enterococcus faecalis, 91.3{\%} of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 88{\%} of Staphylococcus epidermidis but was least able to identify Enterococcus faecium (71.4{\%} correct). More than 90{\%} of gram-positive cocci were identified within 3 h. According to the NCCLS breakpoints, antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the VITEK 2 system gave 96{\%} correct category agreement, 0.82{\%} very major errors, 0.17{\%} major errors, and 2.7{\%} minor errors. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed category agreement from 94 to 100{\%} for S. aureus, from 90 to 100{\%} for CNS, from 91 to 100{\%} for enterococci, from 96 to 100{\%} for S. agalactiae, and from 91 to 100{\%} for S. pneumoniae. Microorganism-antibiotic combinations that gave very major errors were CNS-erythromycin, CNS-oxacillin, enterococci-teicoplanin, and enterococci-high-concentration gentamicin. Major errors were observed for CNS-oxacillin and S. agalactiae-tetracycline combinations. In conclusion the results of this study indicate that the VITEK 2 system represents an accurate and acceptable means for performing identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests with medically relevant gram-positive cocci.},

abstract = {Background: Despite thorough analyses of the analytical performance of Clostridium difficile tests and test algorithms, the financial impact at hospital level has not been well described. Such a model should take institution-specific variables into account, such as incidence, request behaviour and infection control policies. Aim: To calculate the total hospital costs of different test algorithms, accounting for days on which infected patients with toxigenic strains were not isolated and therefore posed an infectious risk for new/secondary nosocomial infections. Methods: A mathematical algorithm was developed to gather the above parameters using data from seven Flemish hospital laboratories (Bilulu Microbiology Study Group) (number of tests, local prevalence and hospital hygiene measures). Measures of sensitivity and specificity for the evaluated tests were taken from the literature. List prices and costs of assays were provided by the manufacturer or the institutions. The calculated cost included reagent costs, personnel costs and the financial burden following due and undue isolations and antibiotic therapies. Five different test algorithms were compared. Findings and conclusion: A dynamic calculation model was constructed to evaluate the cost:benefit ratio of each algorithm for a set of institution- and time-dependent inputted variables (prevalence, cost fluctuations and test performances), making it possible to choose the most advantageous algorithm for its setting. A two-step test algorithm with concomitant glutamate dehydrogenase and toxin testing, followed by a rapid molecular assay was found to be the most cost-effective algorithm. This enabled resolution of almost all cases on the day of arrival, minimizing the number of unnecessary or missing isolations.},

As there is a pressing need for the development of therapeutic agents, we screened 230 new mouse anti-CHIKV monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) for their ability to inhibit infection of all three CHIKV genotypes. Four of 36 neutralizing MAbs (CHK-102, CHK-152, CHK-166, and CHK-263) provided complete protection against lethality as prophylaxis in highly susceptible immunocompromised mice lacking the type I IFN receptor (Ifnar(-/-) ) and mapped to distinct epitopes on the E1 and E2 structural proteins. CHK-152, the most protective MAb, was humanized, shown to block viral fusion, and require Fc effector function for optimal activity in vivo. In post-exposure therapeutic trials, administration of a single dose of a combination of two neutralizing MAbs (CHK-102+CHK-152 or CHK-166+CHK-152) limited the development of resistance and protected immunocompromised mice against disease when given 24 to 36 hours before CHIKV-induced death.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:If positive-outcome bias exists, it threatens the integrity of evidence-based medicine.

METHODS:We sought to determine whether positive-outcome bias is present during peer review by testing whether peer reviewers would (1) recommend publication of a "positive" version of a fabricated manuscript over an otherwise identical "no-difference" version, (2) identify more purposefully placed errors in the no-difference version, and (3) rate the "Methods" section in the positive version more highly than the identical "Methods" section in the no-difference version. Two versions of a well-designed randomized controlled trial that differed only in the direction of the finding of the principal study end point were submitted for peer review to 2 journals in 2008-2009. Of 238 reviewers for The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery and Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research randomly allocated to review either a positive or a no-difference version of the manuscript, 210 returned reviews.

RESULTS:Reviewers were more likely to recommend the positive version of the test manuscript for publication than the no-difference version (97.3{\%} vs 80.0{\%}, P {\textless} .001). Reviewers detected more errors in the no-difference version than in the positive version (0.85 vs 0.41, P {\textless} .001). Reviewers awarded higher methods scores to the positive manuscript than to the no-difference manuscript (8.24 vs 7.53, P = .005), although the "Methods" sections in the 2 versions were identical.

CONCLUSIONS:Positive-outcome bias was present during peer review. A fabricated manuscript with a positive outcome was more likely to be recommended for publication than was an otherwise identical no-difference manuscript.},

abstract = {The H3N2 influenza virus A/Philippines/82 (Phil82) and its bovine serum-resistant mutant, Phil82/BS, were used to investigate factors that influence virulence of influenza virus for mice. Phil82/BS, which lacks the high-mannose oligosaccharide at residue 165 of the hemagglutinin (HA) molecule, was found to replicate to a much higher titer in mouse lung than the parent Phil82, and had acquired lethality for mice. Further adaptation of Phil82/BS by sequential lung passage in mice yielded a strain of greater virulence, Phil82/BS/ML 10, in which a change at residue 246 of HA resulted in loss of a second potential glycosylation site. Phil82 is highly sensitive to neutralization in vitro by murine serum- and lung-associated mannose-binding lectins (collectins). Characterization of the two mutant viruses indicated that resistance to murine collectins can account for the enhanced virulence of Phil82/BS but not for the further increase in virulence of Phil82/BS/ML10. Evidence is presented that residue 246 is not in fact glycosylated in Phil82/BS HA, nor presumably in the parent Phil82 virus. The HA molecule of Phil82/BS/ML10 displayed functional differences from Phil82/BS, including a change in the optimum pH of fusion and a minor change in receptor-binding specificity, which may allow improved efficiency of replication in the mouse lung.},

abstract = {Most cancer cells release heterogeneous populations of extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. In vitro experiments showed that EV uptake can lead to transfer of functional mRNA and altered cellular behavior. However, similar in vivo experiments remain challenging because cells that take up EVs cannot be discriminated from non-EV-receiving cells. Here, we used the Cre-LoxP system to directly identify tumor cells that take up EVs in vivo. We show that EVs released by malignant tumor cells are taken up by less malignant tumor cells located within the same and within distant tumors and that these EVs carry mRNAs involved in migration and metastasis. By intravital imaging, we show that the less malignant tumor cells that take up EVs display enhanced migratory behavior and metastatic capacity. We postulate that tumor cells locally and systemically share molecules carried by EVs in vivo and that this affects cellular behavior.},

abstract = {Staphylococci are an increasing cause of bloodstream infections. Rapid reliable identification of these organisms is essential for accurate diagnosis and prompt effective treatment. We evaluated the ability of the VITEK 2 system (bioM{\'{e}}rieux, Inc, Hazelwood, Mo.) to identify these organisms rapidly and accurately. A total of 405 clinically relevant nonduplicate staphylococcal isolates (Staphylococcus aureus, n = 130; coagulase-negative staphylococci, n = 275) collected from blood cultures were tested. VITEK 2 results were considered correct when they were identical to those furnished by the comparison method based on the ID 32 STAPH system (bioM{\'{e}}rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) plus supplementary manual testing. When discrepancies occurred, isolate identity was verified by molecular typing. The VITEK 2 correctly identified 387 (95.6{\%}) isolates at the species level: 379 (including all but one [99.2{\%}] of 130 S. aureus isolates and 249 of 275 [90.5{\%}] coagulase-negative isolates) were identified by the automated reading; for the other eight, supplemental tests suggested by the manufacturer had to be used. Only one strain (0.2{\%}) was misidentified (Staphylococcus hominis as Staphylococcus epidermidis), and four (1{\%}), all S. epidermidis, were not identified. For the remaining 13 strains (including 10 S. hominis), the VITEK 2 system was unable to discriminate among two species, and no supplemental tests were suggested for conclusive identification. Over 90{\%} of results were obtained within 4 h. These results suggest that the VITEK 2 system can provide rapid, accurate, and reliable species-level identification of staphylococci responsible for bloodstream infections, although there is room for improvement in the identification of certain coagulase-negative species, especially S. hominis.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE Many health care facilities compound medications on site to fulfill local demands when customized formulations are needed, national supply is critically low, or costs for manufactured pharmaceuticals are excessive. Small, institutional compounding facilities may perform the same high-risk procedures as large distributors of compounded medications. OBJECTIVES To investigate an outbreak related to contamination of compounded sterile preparations and to determine processes to prevent future outbreaks. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We performed an outbreak investigation of inpatients at Duke University Hospital from August 31 through September 6, 2012. The investigation included a case-control study, compounding facility inspection and environmental sampling, observation of a mock compounding demonstration, and microbiologic and molecular testing of sequestered medication. EXPOSURES Intravenous fentanyl prepared by an institutional compounding pharmacy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Microbiologic and molecular evidence of contamination of a compounded sterile preparation and failure of routine sterility testing. RESULTS Blood cultures of 7 patients during a 7-day period at Duke University Hospital yielded pan-susceptible Burkholderia cepacia complex bacteria. The risk factor common to all patients was receipt of continuous fentanyl infusion prepared by our institutional compounding pharmacy (odds ratio, 11.22; 95{\%} CI, 2.09-∞; P = .01). The outbreak was terminated after sequestration of compounded fentanyl. An intensive evaluation of the compounding facility, its practice, and its procedures was completed. Investigators evaluated the clean room, collected targeted microbiologic samples within the compounding pharmacy environment, and observed a mock demonstration of compounding practice. The B cepacia complex was found in the anteroom sink drain and pH probe calibration fluid from the compounding clean room. Multiple microbiologic analyses of sequestered fentanyl initially failed. Ultimately, a batched, vacuum-assisted filtration method produced B cepacia complex from a single lot. Molecular analyses using repetitive element polymerase chain reaction and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis confirmed a clonal Burkholderia contaminans strain from patients, fentanyl, and environmental samples. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE An outbreak of B contaminans bacteremia was linked to contamination of locally compounded intravenous fentanyl. Health care facilities that house institutional compounding facilities must be vigilant in efforts to prevent, recognize, and terminate medication-related outbreaks.},

abstract = {Emergence of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia as a nosocomial pathogen is becoming increasingly apparent. Pleiotropic resistance characterizes S. maltophilia. Furthermore, a slow growth rate and an increased mutation rate generate discordance between in vitro susceptibility testing and clinical outcome. Despite original susceptibility, drug-resistant strains of S. maltophilia are often recovered from patients receiving beta-lactams, quinolones, or aminoglycosides. Given the disparity among various in vitro susceptibility methods, this study incorporated a unique pharmacodynamic model to more accurately characterize the bacterial time-kill curves and mutation rates of four clinical isolates of S. maltophilia following exposure to simulated multidose regimens of ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and ticarcillin-clavulanate. Time-kill data demonstrated regrowth of S. maltophilia with all four agents. With the exception of ticarcillin-clavulanate, viable bacterial counts at the end of 24 h exceeded the starting inoculum. Ciprofloxacin only reduced bacterial counts by less than 1.0 log prior to rapid bacterial regrowth. Resistant mutant strains, identical to their parent strain by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, were observed following exposure to each class of antibiotic. Mutant strains also had distinct susceptibility patterns. These data are consistent with previous reports which suggest that S. maltophilia, despite susceptibility data that imply that the organism is sensitive, develops multiple forms of resistance quickly and against several classes of antimicrobial agents. Standard in vitro susceptibility methods are not completely reliable for detecting resistant S. maltophilia strains; and therefore, interpretation of these results should be done with caution. In vivo studies are needed to determine optimal therapy against S. maltophilia infections.},

abstract = {Identifying variations in DNA that increase susceptibility to disease is one of the primary aims of genetic studies using a forward genetics approach. However, identification of disease-susceptibility genes by means of such studies provides limited functional information on how genes lead to disease. In fact, in most cases there is an absence of functional information altogether, preventing a definitive identification of the susceptibility gene or genes. Here we develop an alternative to the classic forward genetics approach for dissecting complex disease traits where, instead of identifying susceptibility genes directly affected by variations in DNA, we identify gene networks that are perturbed by susceptibility loci and that in turn lead to disease. Application of this method to liver and adipose gene expression data generated from a segregating mouse population results in the identification of a macrophage-enriched network supported as having a causal relationship with disease traits associated with metabolic syndrome. Three genes in this network, lipoprotein lipase (Lpl), lactamase beta (Lactb) and protein phosphatase 1-like (Ppm1l), are validated as previously unknown obesity genes, strengthening the association between this network and metabolic disease traits. Our analysis provides direct experimental support that complex traits such as obesity are emergent properties of molecular networks that are modulated by complex genetic loci and environmental factors.},

Given two genomes represented as signed permutations of the same elements (e.g. orthologous genes), the problem consists in finding a most parsimonious scenario of reversals that transforms one genome into the other. Following the first polynomial solution of this problem, several improvements, simplifications, generalizations, tutorials or surveys have been published on the subject. While the reversal distance problem-i.e. the problem of computing the minimum number of reversals in a sorting sequence, without giving the sequence itself-seems to be well explored, the problem of giving a scenario realizing the distance still raises some open questions, one of which by Ozery-Flato and Shamir about whether an algorithm with subquadratic time complexity could ever be achieved for solving the problem. We give a positive answer to this question by describing an algorithm of time complexity O (n3 / 2 sqrt(log n)). {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90{\%} success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code.

abstract = {Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus that causes chronic and incapacitating arthralgia in humans. To date, interactions between the immune system and the different stages of the virus life cycle remain poorly defined. We demonstrated for the first time that CHIKV Ags could be detected in vivo in the monocytes of acutely infected patients. Using in vitro experimental systems, whole blood and purified monocytes, we confirmed that monocytes could be infected and virus growth could be sustained. CHIKV interactions with monocytes, and with other blood leukocytes, induced a robust and rapid innate immune response with the production of specific chemokines and cytokines. In particular, high levels of IFN-alpha were produced rapidly after CHIKV incubation with monocytes. The identification of monocytes during the early phase of CHIKV infection in vivo is significant as infected monocyte/macrophage cells have been detected in the synovial tissues of chronically CHIKV-infected patients, and these cells may behave as the vehicles for virus dissemination. This may explain the persistence of joint symptoms despite the short duration of viremia. Our results provide a better understanding on the basic mechanisms of infection and early antiviral immune responses and will help in the development of future effective control strategies.},

abstract = {As next-generation sequencing projects generate massive genome-wide sequence variation data, bioinformatics tools are being developed to provide computational predictions on the functional effects of sequence variations and narrow down the search of casual variants for disease phenotypes. Different classes of sequence variations at the nucleotide level are involved in human diseases, including substitutions, insertions, deletions, frameshifts, and non-sense mutations. Frameshifts and non-sense mutations are likely to cause a negative effect on protein function. Existing prediction tools primarily focus on studying the deleterious effects of single amino acid substitutions through examining amino acid conservation at the position of interest among related sequences, an approach that is not directly applicable to insertions or deletions. Here, we introduce a versatile alignment-based score as a new metric to predict the damaging effects of variations not limited to single amino acid substitutions but also in-frame insertions, deletions, and multiple amino acid substitutions. This alignment-based score measures the change in sequence similarity of a query sequence to a protein sequence homolog before and after the introduction of an amino acid variation to the query sequence. Our results showed that the scoring scheme performs well in separating disease-associated variants (n = 21,662) from common polymorphisms (n = 37,022) for UniProt human protein variations, and also in separating deleterious variants (n = 15,179) from neutral variants (n = 17,891) for UniProt non-human protein variations. In our approach, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the human and non-human protein variation datasets is ∼0.85. We also observed that the alignment-based score correlates with the deleteriousness of a sequence variation. In summary, we have developed a new algorithm, PROVEAN (Protein Variation Effect Analyzer), which provides a generalized approach to predict the functional effects of protein sequence variations including single or multiple amino acid substitutions, and in-frame insertions and deletions. The PROVEAN tool is available online at http://provean.jcvi.org.},

abstract = {The pandemic H1N1 virus of 2009 (2009 H1N1) continues to cause illness worldwide, primarily in younger age groups. To better understand the pathogenesis of these viruses in mammals, we used a mouse model to evaluate the relative virulence of selected 2009 H1N1 viruses and compared them to a representative human triple-reassortant swine influenza virus that has circulated in pigs in the United States for over a decade preceding the current pandemic. Additional comparisons were made with the reconstructed 1918 virus, a 1976 H1N1 swine influenza virus, and a highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. Mice were inoculated intranasally with each virus and monitored for morbidity, mortality, viral replication, hemostatic parameters, cytokine production, and lung histology. All 2009 H1N1 viruses replicated efficiently in the lungs of mice and possessed a high degree of infectivity but did not cause lethal disease or exhibit extrapulmonary virus spread. Transient weight loss, lymphopenia, and proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production were present following 2009 H1N1 virus infection, but these levels were generally muted compared with a triple-reassortant swine virus and the 1918 virus. 2009 H1N1 viruses isolated from fatal cases did not demonstrate enhanced virulence in this model compared with isolates from mild human cases. Histologically, infection with the 2009 viruses resulted in lesions in the lung varying from mild to moderate bronchiolitis with occasional necrosis of bronchiolar epithelium and mild to moderate peribronchiolar alveolitis. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that the 2009 H1N1 viruses exhibited mild to moderate virulence in mice compared with highly pathogenic viruses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Global control of tuberculosis is hampered by slow, insensitive diagnostic methods, particularly for the detection of drug-resistant forms and in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Early detection is essential to reduce the death rate and interrupt transmission, but the complexity and infrastructure needs of sensitive methods limit their accessibility and effect. METHODS: We assessed the performance of Xpert MTB/RIF, an automated molecular test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and resistance to rifampin (RIF), with fully integrated sample processing in 1730 patients with suspected drug-sensitive or multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis. Eligible patients in Peru, Azerbaijan, South Africa, and India provided three sputum specimens each. Two specimens were processed with N-acetyl-L-cysteine and sodium hydroxide before microscopy, solid and liquid culture, and the MTB/RIF test, and one specimen was used for direct testing with microscopy and the MTB/RIF test. RESULTS: Among culture-positive patients, a single, direct MTB/RIF test identified 551 of 561 patients with smear-positive tuberculosis (98.2{\%}) and 124 of 171 with smear-negative tuberculosis (72.5{\%}). The test was specific in 604 of 609 patients without tuberculosis (99.2{\%}). Among patients with smear-negative, culture-positive tuberculosis, the addition of a second MTB/RIF test increased sensitivity by 12.6 percentage points and a third by 5.1 percentage points, to a total of 90.2{\%}. As compared with phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing, MTB/RIF testing correctly identified 200 of 205 patients (97.6{\%}) with rifampin-resistant bacteria and 504 of 514 (98.1{\%}) with rifampin-sensitive bacteria. Sequencing resolved all but two cases in favor of the MTB/RIF assay. CONCLUSIONS: The MTB/RIF test provided sensitive detection of tuberculosis and rifampin resistance directly from untreated sputum in less than 2 hours with minimal hands-on time.

With the increased adoption and evolution of electronic medical records (EMRs), there is a need to assimilate the tools of ASPs into EMRs, using decision support and feedback. Third-party software vendors provide the mainstay for integration of individual institutional EMR and ASP efforts. Epic is the leading implementer of EMR technology in the United States. A collaboration of physicians and pharmacists are working closely with Epic to provide a more comprehensive platform of ASP tools that may be institutionally individualized. We review the historical relationship between ASPs and the EMR, cite examples of Epic stewardship tools from 3 academic medical centers' ASPs, discuss limitations of these Epic tools, and conclude with the current process in evolution to integrate ASP tools and decision support capacities directly into Epic's EMR.},

abstract = {Dengue is a systemic viral infection transmitted between humans by Aedes mosquitoes. For some patients, dengue is a life-threatening illness. There are currently no licensed vaccines or specific therapeutics, and substantial vector control efforts have not stopped its rapid emergence and global spread. The contemporary worldwide distribution of the risk of dengue virus infection and its public health burden are poorly known. Here we undertake an exhaustive assembly of known records of dengue occurrence worldwide, and use a formal modelling framework to map the global distribution of dengue risk. We then pair the resulting risk map with detailed longitudinal information from dengue cohort studies and population surfaces to infer the public health burden of dengue in 2010. We predict dengue to be ubiquitous throughout the tropics, with local spatial variations in risk influenced strongly by rainfall, temperature and the degree of urbanization. Using cartographic approaches, we estimate there to be 390 million (95{\%} credible interval 284-528) dengue infections per year, of which 96 million (67-136) manifest apparently (any level of disease severity). This infection total is more than three times the dengue burden estimate of the World Health Organization. Stratification of our estimates by country allows comparison with national dengue reporting, after taking into account the probability of an apparent infection being formally reported. The most notable differences are discussed. These new risk maps and infection estimates provide novel insights into the global, regional and national public health burden imposed by dengue. We anticipate that they will provide a starting point for a wider discussion about the global impact of this disease and will help to guide improvements in disease control strategies using vaccine, drug and vector control methods, and in their economic evaluation.},

abstract = {Background. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) incidence has increased dramatically over the last decade. Recent studies suggest asymptomatic carriers may be an important reservoir of C. difficile in healthcare settings. We sought to identify the prevalence and risk factors for asymptomatic C. difficile carriage on admission to the hospital. Methods. Patients admitted to Barnes-Jewish Hospital without diarrhea were enrolled from June, 2010, through October, 2011. Demographics and healthcare and medication exposures 90 days prior to admission were collected. Stool specimens or rectal swabs were collected within 48 hours of admission and stored at -30(°)C until cultured. C. difficile isolates were typed and compared to isolates from patients with CDI. Results. 259 subjects enrolled had an admission stool/swab specimen. 204 (79{\%}) were not colonized, 40(15{\%}) had toxigenic C. difficile (TCD), and 15 (6{\%}) had nontoxigenic C. difficile. There were no differences between TCD colonized and uncolonized subjects for age (mean 56 vs.58, p=.46), comorbidities, admission from another healthcare facility (33{\%} vs. 24{\%}, p=.23), or recent hospitalization (50{\%} vs. 50{\%}, p=.43).There were no differences in antimicrobial exposures in the 90 days prior to admission (55{\%} vs. 56{\%}, p= .91). Asymptomatic carriers were colonized with strains similar to strains from patients with CDI, but the relative proportions were different. Conclusions. There was a high prevalence of TCD colonization on admission. In contrast to past studies, TCD colonization was not associated with recent antimicrobial or healthcare exposures. Additional investigation is needed to determine the role of asymptomatic TCD carriers on hospital-onset CDI incidence.},

@article{Wilcox1996,
abstract = {Clostridium difficile infection has become endemic in many hospitals and yet few data on the associated costs of such cases are available. We prospectively followed 50 consecutive cases of C. difficile infection and 92 control patients, who were admitted to the same geriatric wards within 72 h of the cases. Cases and controls had similar age, sex and major diagnosis distributions. Cases stayed significantly longer (mean 21.3 days, median 20.5 days; P {\textless} 0.001) in hospital than controls, including an average 14 days in a side room. Diarrhoea developed in cases on average 10.8 days after admission, which, when compared with a mean duration of stay for controls of 25.2 days, implies that C. difficile infection caused an increased duration of stay, as opposed to infection occurring because of longer residence. There was a significantly higher death rate in cases compared with controls (P {\textless} 0.01). Antibiotic treatment of C. difficile infection cost an average of Pounds 47 per case. The average number of laboratory investigations per day was similar for cases and controls, but the increased length of stay meant an extra cost for tests of approximately Pounds 210 per case. Assuming hotel costs of Pounds 150 (Pounds 200) per day stay (in a side room), 94{\%} of the additional costs associated with C. difficile infection were due to increased duration of stay (Pounds 3850). The total identifiable increased cost of C. difficile infection was, therefore, in excess of Pounds 4000 per case. Such high costs can be used to justify expenditure on personnel and/or other control measures to reduce the incidence of this hospital-acquired infection.},

abstract = {Despite the public attention to antibiotic overuse and the specter of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, current infections necessitate the use of antibiotics. Yet, patients and providers may not fully consider the societal cost associated with inappropriate antimicrobial use and subsequent resistance. Policies intended to limit use to minimize resistance must be balanced with the competing concern of underutilization. It is difficult to determine whether research and development incentives or reducing the costs of bringing new antibiotics through expedited review will be sufficient. Likely, the most effective method would be allowing higher prices for use deemed to be clinically appropriate. The ultimate policy goal is to ensure that antibiotics are used appropriately, with the right patients receiving the right medication at the right time, and that the world has a steady stream of future antibiotics to effectively treat the resistant organisms that will inevitably emerge.},

abstract = {Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs) are traditionally seen in elderly and hospitalized patients who have used antibiotic therapy. In the community, CDIs requiring a visit to a general practitioner are increasingly occurring among young and relatively healthy individuals without known predisposing factors. C. difficile is also found as a commensal or pathogen in the intestinal tracts of most mammals, and various birds and reptiles. In the environment, including soil and water, C. difficile may be ubiquitous; however, this is based on limited evidence. Food products such as (processed) meat, fish and vegetables can also contain C. difficile, but studies conducted in Europe report lower prevalence rates than in North America. Absolute counts of toxigenic C. difficile in the environment and food are low, however the exact infectious dose is unknown. To date, direct transmission of C. difficile from animals, food or the environment to humans has not been proven, although similar PCR ribotypes are found. We therefore believe that the overall epidemiology of human CDI is not driven by amplification in animals or other sources. As no outbreaks of CDI have been reported among humans in the community, host factors that increase vulnerability to CDI might be of more importance than increased exposure to C. difficile. Conversely, emerging C. difficile ribotype 078 is found in high numbers in piglets, calves, and their immediate environment. Although there is no direct evidence proving transmission to humans, circumstantial evidence points towards a zoonotic potential of this type. In future emerging PCR ribotypes, zoonotic potential needs to be considered.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants for thousands of diseases and traits. We evaluated the relationships between specific risk factors (for example, blood cholesterol level) and diseases on the basis of their shared genetic architecture in a comprehensive human disease-single-nucleotide polymorphism association database (VARIMED), analyzing the findings from 8962 published association studies. Similarity between traits and diseases was statistically evaluated on the basis of their association with shared gene variants. We identified 120 disease-trait pairs that were statistically similar, and of these, we tested and validated five previously unknown disease-trait associations by searching electronic medical records (EMRs) from three independent medical centers for evidence of the trait appearing in patients within 1 year of first diagnosis of the disease. We validated that the mean corpuscular volume is elevated before diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia; both have associated variants in the gene IKZF1. Platelet count is decreased before diagnosis of alcohol dependence; both are associated with variants in the gene C12orf51. Alkaline phosphatase level is elevated in patients with venous thromboembolism; both share variants in ABO. Similarly, we found that prostate-specific antigen and serum magnesium levels were altered before the diagnosis of lung cancer and gastric cancer, respectively. Disease-trait associations identify traits that could serve as future prognostics, if validated through EMR and subsequent prospective trials.},

abstract = {Common DNA variants alter the expression levels and patterns of many human genes. Loci responsible for this genetic control are known as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). The resulting variation of gene expression across individuals has been postulated to be a determinant of phenotypic variation and susceptibility to complex disease. In the past, the application of expression microarray and genetic variation data to study populations enabled the rapid identification of eQTLs in model organisms and humans. Now, a new technology promises to revolutionize the field. Massively parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides unprecedented resolution, allowing us to accurately monitor not only the expression output of each genomic locus but also reconstruct and quantify alternatively spliced transcripts. RNA-seq also provides new insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying eQTLs. Here, we discuss the major advances introduced by RNA-seq and summarize current progress towards understanding the role of eQTLs in determining human phenotypic diversity.},

abstract = {Human influenza A viruses are rapidly evolving pathogens that cause substantial morbidity and mortality in seasonal epidemics around the globe. To ensure continued protection, the strains used for the production of the seasonal influenza vaccine have to be regularly updated, which involves data collection and analysis by numerous experts worldwide. Computer-guided analysis is becoming increasingly important in this problem due to the vast amounts of generated data. We here describe a computational method for selecting a suitable strain for production of the human influenza A virus vaccine. It interprets available antigenic and genomic sequence data based on measures of antigenic novelty and rate of propagation of the viral strains throughout the population. For viral isolates sampled between 2002 and 2007 we used this method to predict the antigenic evolution of the H3N2 viruses in retrospective testing scenarios. When seasons are scored as true or false predictions, our method returned six true positives, three false negatives, eight true negatives and one false positive prediction or 77{\%} accuracy overall. In comparison to the recommendations by the WHO, we identified the correct antigenic variant once at the same time and twice one season ahead. Even though it cannot be ruled out that practical reasons such as lack of a sufficiently well-growing candidate strain may in some cases have prevented recommendation of the best matching strain by the WHO, our computational decision procedure allows to quantitatively interpret the growing amounts of data and may help to match the vaccine better to predominating strains in seasonal influenza epidemics.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIMPORTANCE: Human influenza A viruses continuously change antigenically to circumvent the immune protection evoked by vaccination or previously circulating viral strains. To maintain vaccine protection and thereby reduce the mortality and morbidity caused by infections, regular updates of the vaccine strains are required. We have developed a data-driven framework for vaccine strain prediction which facilitates the computational analysis of genetic and antigenic data and does not rely on explicit evolutionary models. Our computational decision procedure generated good matches of the vaccine strain to the circulating predominant strain for most seasons and could be used to support the expert-guided prediction made by the WHO and may allow to further increase vaccine efficiency.},

@article{Deloger2009,
abstract = {The fundamental unit of biological diversity is the species. However, a remarkable extent of intraspecies diversity in bacteria was discovered by genome sequencing, and it reveals the need to develop clear criteria to group strains within a species. Two main types of analyses used to quantify intraspecies variation at the genome level are the average nucleotide identity (ANI), which detects the DNA conservation of the core genome, and the DNA content, which calculates the proportion of DNA shared by two genomes. Both estimates are based on BLAST alignments for the definition of DNA sequences common to the genome pair. Interestingly, however, results using these methods on intraspecies pairs are not well correlated. This prompted us to develop a genomic-distance index taking into account both criteria of diversity, which are based on DNA maximal unique matches (MUM) shared by two genomes. The values, called MUMi, for MUM index, correlate better with the ANI than with the DNA content. Moreover, the MUMi groups strains in a way that is congruent with routinely used multilocus sequence-typing trees, as well as with ANI-based trees. We used the MUMi to determine the relatedness of all available genome pairs at the species and genus levels. Our analysis reveals a certain consistency in the current notion of bacterial species, in that the bulk of intraspecies and intragenus values are clearly separable. It also confirms that some species are much more diverse than most. As the MUMi is fast to calculate, it offers the possibility of measuring genome distances on the whole database of available genomes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Three different subsets of circulating human monocytes, CD14(bright)CD16- (classical), CD14(bright)CD16+ (intermediate), and CD14(dim)CD16+ (non-classical) have been recently identified. It has been reported that CD14(bright)CD16+ monocytes are increased in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the role of each monocyte subset in the pathogenesis of RA is still unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of CD14(bright)CD16+ monocytes with RA. METHODS The study enrolled 35 patients with RA and 14 healthy volunteers. The three subsets of peripheral blood monocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Serum cytokines were measured at baseline in patients with RA and in healthy volunteers. CD14(bright)CD16- monocytes were isolated and cultured in vitro with different cytokines for 14 hours, and CD16 induction was assessed. RESULTS The proportion of CD14(bright)CD16+ monocytes, and serum interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were increased in patients with RA compared to healthy controls. The proportion of CD14brightCD16+ monocytes correlated with the disease activity of RA positively, whereas the proportion of CD14(bright)CD16- monocytes correlated negatively. When isolated CD14(bright)CD16- monocytes were stimulated with IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10, the only cytokine that significantly induced CD16 expression on the cells was IL-10. CONCLUSIONS The proportion of CD16(bright)CD14+ monocytes was positively correlated with RA disease activity. The expression of CD16 in monocytes was induced by IL-10 but not IL-6, and IL-8 was enhanced in the sera of patients with RA. Our results suggest that CD16(bright)CD14+ monocytes are involved in the pathogenesis of RA and that IL-10 is a key cytokine that regulates CD16 expression in monocytes.},

abstract = {Despite 70 years of study, dengue disease continues to be a global health burden. Treatment is only supportive based on presenting symptoms. To date, there is no licensed prophylactic vaccine and no specific antiviral drugs available. The pathogenesis mechanisms during dengue virus infections remain poorly understood, and the complete picture on risk factors for developing severe clinical illness is still unknown. Viruses as obligate intracellular parasites depend on the host cell machinery for replication. As a result of a co-evolution process for million years, viruses have developed sophisticated strategies to hijack and use cellular factors for entry, replication and propagation, alternate host transmission and to combat host cell defenses. This review focuses on recent reports about cellular proteins involved along the dengue virus replication cycle, in prime cellular targets during the infection of both humans and mosquito hosts and also on the proteomics and other approaches that are being used to reveal the entire orchestration and most significant processes altered during infection. Identification of the key host cell factors involve in these processes will provide a better understanding of how viruses replicate and cause disease, and how to develop more effective therapeutic interventions. Biological significance: Dengue disease is as a global health problem. The treatment is only supportive based on presenting symptoms. To date, there is no licensed prophylactic vaccine and no specific antiviral drugs available. The study of the interactions between virus and host cell proteins will provide a better understanding of how viruses replicate and cause disease. Here, we focus on the current knowledge about the cellular proteins involved during DENV infection in different target cells in the two hosts, mosquito and human.

abstract = {Hereditary pancreatitis (HP) is a rare inherited disorder, characterised by recurrent episodes of pancreatitis often beginning in early childhood. The mode of inheritance suggests an autosomal dominant trait with incomplete penetrance. The gene, or at least one of the genes, responsible for hereditary pancreatitis has been mapped to the long arm of chromosome 7 and a missense mutation, an arginine to histidine substitution at residue 117 in the trypsinogen cationic gene (try4) has been shown to segregate with the HP phenotype. The aim of this work was to investigate the molecular basis of hereditary pancreatitis. This study was performed on 14 HP families. The five exons of the trypsinogen cationic gene were studied using a specific gene amplification assay combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The present paper describes three novel mutations, namely K23R and N29I and a deletion -28delTCC in the promoter region. We also found a polymorphism in exon 4, D162D. In eight of these families we found a mutation which segregates with the disease. A segregation analysis using microsatellite markers carried out on the other families suggests genetic heterogeneity in at least one of them. Our findings confirm the implication of the cationic trypsinogen gene in HP and highlight allelic diversity associated with this phenotype. We also show that the pattern of inheritance of HP is probably complex and that other genes may be involved in this genetic disease.},

abstract = {For viruses to productively infect their hosts, they must evade or inhibit important elements of the innate immune system, namely the type I interferon (IFN) response, which negatively influences the subsequent development of antigen-specific adaptive immunity against those viruses. Dengue virus (DENV) can inhibit both type I IFN production and signaling in susceptible human cells, including dendritic cells (DCs). The NS2B3 protease complex of DENV functions as an antagonist of type I IFN production, and its proteolytic activity is necessary for this function. DENV also encodes proteins that antagonize type I IFN signaling, including NS2A, NS4A, NS4B and NS5 by targeting different components of this signaling pathway, such as STATs. Importantly, the ability of the NS5 protein to bind and degrade STAT2 contributes to the limited host tropism of DENV to humans and non-human primates. In this review, we will evaluate the contribution of innate immunity evasion by DENV to the pathogenesis and host tropism of this virus.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Next-generation sequencing technologies have decentralized sequence acquisition, increasing the demand for new bioinformatics tools that are easy to use, portable across multiple platforms, and scalable for high-throughput applications. Cloud computing platforms provide on-demand access to computing infrastructure over the Internet and can be used in combination with custom built virtual machines to distribute pre-packaged with pre-configured software.

RESULTS: We describe the Cloud Virtual Resource, CloVR, a new desktop application for push-button automated sequence analysis that can utilize cloud computing resources. CloVR is implemented as a single portable virtual machine (VM) that provides several automated analysis pipelines for microbial genomics, including 16S, whole genome and metagenome sequence analysis. The CloVR VM runs on a personal computer, utilizes local computer resources and requires minimal installation, addressing key challenges in deploying bioinformatics workflows. In addition CloVR supports use of remote cloud computing resources to improve performance for large-scale sequence processing. In a case study, we demonstrate the use of CloVR to automatically process next-generation sequencing data on multiple cloud computing platforms.

CONCLUSION: The CloVR VM and associated architecture lowers the barrier of entry for utilizing complex analysis protocols on both local single- and multi-core computers and cloud systems for high throughput data processing.},

abstract = {The seasonal human influenza A/H3N2 virus undergoes rapid evolution, which produces significant year-to-year sequence turnover in the population of circulating strains. Adaptive mutations respond to human immune challenge and occur primarily in antigenic epitopes, the antibody-binding domains of the viral surface protein haemagglutinin. Here we develop a fitness model for haemagglutinin that predicts the evolution of the viral population from one year to the next. Two factors are shown to determine the fitness of a strain: adaptive epitope changes and deleterious mutations outside the epitopes. We infer both fitness components for the strains circulating in a given year, using population-genetic data of all previous strains. From fitness and frequency of each strain, we predict the frequency of its descendent strains in the following year. This fitness model maps the adaptive history of influenza A and suggests a principled method for vaccine selection. Our results call for a more comprehensive epidemiology of influenza and other fast-evolving pathogens that integrates antigenic phenotypes with other viral functions coupled by genetic linkage.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND$\backslash$nWhereas many antibiotics increase risk of Clostridium difficile infection through dysbiosis, epidemic C difficile ribotypes characterised by multidrug resistance might depend on antibiotic selection pressures arising from population use of specific drugs. We examined the effect of a national antibiotic stewardship intervention limiting the use of 4C antibiotics (fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, co-amoxiclav, and cephalosporins) and other infection prevention and control strategies on the clinical and molecular epidemiology of C difficile infections in northeast Scotland. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS$\backslash$nWe did a non-linear time-series analysis and quasi-experimental study to explore ecological determinants of clinical burdens from C difficile infections and ribotype distributions in a health board serving 11{\%} of the Scottish population. Study populations were adults (aged ≥16 years) registered with primary carer providers in the community (mean 455 508 inhabitants) or admitted to tertiary level, district general, or geriatric hospitals (mean 33 049 total admissions per month). A mixed persuasive-restrictive 4C antibiotic stewardship intervention was initiated in all populations on May 1, 2009. Other population-specific interventions considered included limiting indications for macrolide prescriptions, introduction of alcohol-based hand sanitiser, a national hand-hygiene campaign, national auditing and inspections of hospital environment cleanliness, and reminders to reduce inappropriate use of proton-pump inhibitors. The total effect of interventions was defined as the difference between observations and projected scenarios without intervention. Primary outcomes were prevalence density of C difficile infection per 1000 occupied bed-days in hospitals or per 100 000 inhabitant-days in the community. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nFINDINGS$\backslash$nBetween Jan 1, 1997, and Dec 31, 2012, we identified 4885 cases of hospital-onset C difficile infection among 1 289 929 admissions to study hospitals, and a further 1625 cases of community-onset C difficile infection among 455 508 adults registered in primary care. Use of 4C antibiotics was reduced by 50{\%} in both hospitals (mean reduction 193 defined daily doses per 1000 occupied bed-days, 95{\%} CI 45–328, p=0{\textperiodcentered}008) and the community (1{\textperiodcentered}85 defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitant-days, 95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}23–3{\textperiodcentered}48, p=0{\textperiodcentered}025) during antibiotic stewardship. Falling 4C use predicted rapid declines in multidrug-resistant ribotypes R001 and R027. Hospital-onset C difficile infection prevalence densities were associated with fluoroquinolone, third-generation cephalosporin, macrolides, and carbapenem use, exceeding hospital population specific total use thresholds. Community-onset C difficile infection prevalence density was predicted by recent hospital C difficile infection rates, introduction of mandatory surveillance in individuals older than 65 years, and primary-case use of fluoroquinolones and clindamycin exceeding total use thresholds. Compared with predictions without intervention, C difficile infection prevalence density fell by 68{\%} (mean reduction 1{\textperiodcentered}01 per 1000 occupied bed-days, 0{\textperiodcentered}27–1{\textperiodcentered}76, p=0{\textperiodcentered}008) in hospitals and 45{\%} (0{\textperiodcentered}083, 0{\textperiodcentered}045–0{\textperiodcentered}121 cases per 100 000 inhabitant-days, p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001) in the community, during antibiotic stewardship.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:  Strategies to prevent Staphylococcus aureus infection in hospitals focus on patient-to-patient transmission. We used whole-genome sequencing to investigate the role of colonized patients as the source of new S. aureus acquisitions, and the reliability of identifying patient-to-patient transmission using the conventional approach of spa typing and overlapping patient stay.

METHODS: Over 14 months, all unselected patients admitted to an adult intensive care unit (ICU) were serially screened for S. aureus. All available isolates (n = 275) were spa typed and underwent whole-genome sequencing to investigate their relatedness at high resolution.

RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus was carried by 185 of 1109 patients sampled within 24 hours of ICU admission (16.7{\%}); 59 (5.3{\%}) patients carried methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Forty-four S. aureus (22 MRSA) acquisitions while on ICU were detected. Isolates were available for genetic analysis from 37 acquisitions. Whole-genome sequencing indicated that 7 of these 37 (18.9{\%}) were transmissions from other colonized patients. Conventional methods (spa typing combined with overlapping patient stay) falsely identified 3 patient-to-patient transmissions (all MRSA) and failed to detect 2 acquisitions and 4 transmissions (2 MRSA).

CONCLUSIONS: Only a minority of S. aureus acquisitions can be explained by patient-to-patient transmission. Whole-genome sequencing provides the resolution to disprove transmission events indicated by conventional methods and also to reveal otherwise unsuspected transmission events. Whole-genome sequencing should replace conventional methods for detection of nosocomial S. aureus transmission.},

The objective of this study is to determine whether it is possible to complement these sources of evidence with information about physician "group intelligence" that exists in electronic health records. Specifically, we measured laboratory test "repeat intervals", defined as the amount of time it takes for a physician to repeat a test that was previously ordered for the same patient. Our assumption is that while the result of a test is a direct measure of one marker of a patient's health, the physician's decision to order the test is based on multiple factors including past experience, available treatment options, and information about the patient that might not be coded in the electronic health record. By examining repeat intervals in aggregate over large numbers of patients, we show that it is possible to 1) determine what laboratory test results physicians consider "normal", 2) identify subpopulations of patients that deviate from the norm, and 3) identify situations where laboratory tests are over-ordered. We used laboratory tests as just one example of how physician group intelligence can be used to support evidence based medicine in a way that is automated and continually updated.},

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the costs attributable to hospital-acquired CDI from the healthcare payer perspective. METHODS We conducted a population-based propensity-score matched cohort study of incident hospitalized subjects diagnosed with CDI (those with the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, Canada code A04.7) from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2010, in Ontario, Canada. Infected subjects were matched to uninfected subjects (those without the code A04.7) on age, sex, comorbidities, geography, and other variables, and followed up through December 31, 2011. We stratified results by elective and nonelective admissions. The main study outcomes were up-to-3-year costs, which were evaluated in 2014 Canadian dollars. RESULTS We identified 28,308 infected subjects (mean annual incidence, 27.9 per 100,000 population, 3.3 per 1,000 admissions), with a mean age of 71.5 years (range, 0-107 years), 54.0{\%} female, and 8.0{\%} elective admissions. For elective admission subjects, cumulative mean attributable 1-, 2-, and 3-year costs adjusted for survival (undiscounted) were {\$}32,151 (95{\%} CI, {\$}28,192-{\$}36,005), {\$}34,843 ({\$}29,298-{\$}40,027), and {\$}37,171 ({\$}30,364-{\$}43,415), respectively. For nonelective admission subjects, the corresponding costs were {\$}21,909 ({\$}21,221-{\$}22,609), {\$}26,074 ({\$}25,180-{\$}27,014), and {\$}29,944 ({\$}28,873-{\$}31,086), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Hospital-acquired CDI is associated with substantial healthcare costs. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first CDI costing study to present longitudinal costs. New strategies may be warranted to mitigate this costly infectious disease. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2016;1-11.},

abstract = {Staining with CD14 and CD16 monoclonal antibodies will identify two monocyte subpopulations in human blood: a major population of regular monocytes, which strongly expresses the CD14 antigen (CD14++), and a minor population with weak expression of CD14 and expression of the CD16 antigen (CD14+/CD16+ cells). As shown herein, the latter cells account for 45 +/- 22 cells/microL and 9{\%} +/- 5{\%} of the monocytes in healthy control donors (n = 35). In septicemia patients, the CD14+/CD16+ cells can become a major population, with more than 50{\%} of all monocytes in 3 of 18 patients and with more than 500 cells in 4 of 18 cases. There was no correlation of CD14+/CD16+ cells to any clinical parameter except for CD14+/CD16+ percentage and body temperature (P = .013). The CD14++ regular monocytes showed a substantial decrease in CD14 antigen density in 9 of 11 patients. Three-color immunofluorescence shows that the CD14+/CD16+ monocytes in septicemia patients when compared with the CD14++ monocytes exhibit a higher level of class II antigen and a lower level of CD11b and CD33 antigens, consistent with a more mature nature of the CD14+/CD16+ cells. Levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) were increased in septicemia patients; 3 of 5 patients with high numbers of CD14+/CD16+ cells ({\textgreater} 200/microL) had high levels of IL-6 ({\textgreater} 250/U/mL). These data suggest that septicemia may lead to substantial changes in blood monocyte composition and this may be related to elevated levels of cytokines such as IL-6.},

abstract = {The global emergence of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) multilocus sequence type ST258 is widely recognized. Less is known about the molecular and epidemiological details of non-ST258 K. pneumoniae in the setting of an outbreak mediated by an endemic plasmid. We describe the interplay of blaKPC plasmids and K. pneumoniae strains and their relationship to the location of acquisition in a U.S. health care institution. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis was applied to KPC-Kp clinical isolates collected from a single institution over 5 years following the introduction of blaKPC in August 2007, as well as two plasmid transformants. KPC-Kp from 37 patients yielded 16 distinct sequence types (STs). Two novel conjugative blaKPC plasmids (pKPC{\_}UVA01 and pKPC{\_}UVA02), carried by the hospital index case, accounted for the presence of blaKPC in 21/37 (57{\%}) subsequent cases. Thirteen (35{\%}) isolates represented an emergent lineage, ST941, which contained pKPC{\_}UVA01 in 5/13 (38{\%}) and pKPC{\_}UVA02 in 6/13 (46{\%}) cases. Seven (19{\%}) isolates were the epidemic KPC-Kp strain, ST258, mostly imported from elsewhere and not carrying pKPC{\_}UVA01 or pKPC{\_}UVA02. Using WGS-based analysis of clinical isolates and plasmid transformants, we demonstrate the unexpected dispersal of blaKPC to many non-ST258 lineages in a hospital through spread of at least two novel blaKPC plasmids. In contrast, ST258 KPC-Kp was imported into the institution on numerous occasions, with other blaKPC plasmid vectors and without sustained transmission. Instead, a newly recognized KPC-Kp strain, ST941, became associated with both novel blaKPC plasmids and spread locally, making it a future candidate for clinical persistence and dissemination.},

abstract = {The genetics of complex disease produce alterations in the molecular interactions of cellular pathways whose collective effect may become clear through the organized structure of molecular networks. To characterize molecular systems associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), we constructed gene-regulatory networks in 1,647 postmortem brain tissues from LOAD patients and nondemented subjects, and we demonstrate that LOAD reconfigures specific portions of the molecular interaction structure. Through an integrative network-based approach, we rank-ordered these network structures for relevance to LOAD pathology, highlighting an immune- and microglia-specific module that is dominated by genes involved in pathogen phagocytosis, contains TYROBP as a key regulator, and is upregulated in LOAD. Mouse microglia cells overexpressing intact or truncated TYROBP revealed expression changes that significantly overlapped the human brain TYROBP network. Thus the causal network structure is a useful predictor of response to gene perturbations and presents a framework to test models of disease mechanisms underlying LOAD.},

While Next-Generation sequencing methods may produce reads up to several hundred bases long, SMS sequencing produces reads up to tens of kilobases long. Existing alignment methods are either too inefficient for high-throughput datasets, or not sensitive enough to align SMS reads, which have a higher error rate than Next-Generation sequencing.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We describe the method BLASR (Basic Local Alignment with Successive Refinement) for mapping Single Molecule Sequencing (SMS) reads that are thousands of bases long, with divergence between the read and genome dominated by insertion and deletion error. The method is benchmarked using both simulated reads and reads from a bacterial sequencing project. We also present a combinatorial model of sequencing error that motivates why our approach is effective.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that it is possible to map SMS reads with high accuracy and speed. Furthermore, the inferences made on the mapability of SMS reads using our combinatorial model of sequencing error are in agreement with the mapping accuracy demonstrated on simulated reads.},

Here we evaluated the replication of data analyses in 18 articles on microarray-based gene expression profiling published in Nature Genetics in 2005-2006. One table or figure from each article was independently evaluated by two teams of analysts. We reproduced two analyses in principle and six partially or with some discrepancies; ten could not be reproduced. The main reason for failure to reproduce was data unavailability, and discrepancies were mostly due to incomplete data annotation or specification of data processing and analysis. Repeatability of published microarray studies is apparently limited. More strict publication rules enforcing public data availability and explicit description of data processing and analysis should be considered.},

HISAT (hierarchical indexing for spliced alignment of transcripts), StringTie and Ballgown are free, open-source software tools for comprehensive analysis of RNA-seq experiments. Together, they allow scientists to align reads to a genome, assemble transcripts including novel splice variants, compute the abundance of these transcripts in each sample and compare experiments to identify differentially expressed genes and transcripts. This protocol describes all the steps necessary to process a large set of raw sequencing reads and create lists of gene transcripts, expression levels, and differentially expressed genes and transcripts. The protocol's execution time depends on the computing resources, but it typically takes under 45 min of computer time.

These methods are starting to become a bottleneck in some analysis pipelines when faced with data sets of the size of many thousands of sequences. Some methods allow computation of larger data sets while sacrificing quality, and others produce high-quality alignments, but scale badly with the number of sequences. In this paper, we describe a new program called Clustal Omega, which can align virtually any number of protein sequences quickly and that delivers accurate alignments. The accuracy of the package on smaller test cases is similar to that of the high-quality aligners. On larger data sets, Clustal Omega outperforms other packages in terms of execution time and quality. Clustal Omega also has powerful features for adding sequences to and exploiting information in existing alignments, making use of the vast amount of precomputed information in public databases like Pfam.},

We previously developed a method to infer causal relationships among genes through the integration of DNA variation, gene transcription and phenotypic information. Here we have validated our method through the characterization of transgenic and knockout mouse models of genes predicted to be causal for abdominal obesity. Perturbation of eight out of the nine genes, with Gas7, Me1 and Gpx3 being newly confirmed, resulted in significant changes in obesity-related traits. Liver expression signatures revealed alterations in common metabolic pathways and networks contributing to abdominal obesity and overlapped with a macrophage-enriched metabolic network module that is highly associated with metabolic traits in mice and humans. Integration of gene expression in the design and analysis of traditional F(2) intercross studies allows high-confidence prediction of causal genes and identification of pathways and networks involved.},

We present Cuffdiff 2, an algorithm that estimates expression at transcript-level resolution and controls for variability evident across replicate libraries. Cuffdiff 2 robustly identifies differentially expressed transcripts and genes and reveals differential splicing and promoter-preference changes. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach through differential analysis of lung fibroblasts in response to loss of the developmental transcription factor HOXA1, which we show is required for lung fibroblast and HeLa cell cycle progression. Loss of HOXA1 results in significant expression level changes in thousands of individual transcripts, along with isoform switching events in key regulators of the cell cycle.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Clinical trial registration allows interested parties to obtain information about ongoing and completed trials, but there are few data indicating the quality of the information provided during the registration process. We used information in the publicly available ClinicalTrials.gov database to describe patterns of trial registration before and after the implementation by journal editors of a new policy requiring registration as a prerequisite for publication.

METHODS:We reviewed ClinicalTrials.gov records to determine patterns of completion of the "Intervention Name" and "Primary Outcome Measure" data fields for trials registered on May 20 and October 11, 2005, and for trials registered during the interval between these two dates, inclusively.

RESULTS:During the interval studied, the number of registrations in ClinicalTrials.gov increased by 73 percent from 13,153 to 22,714. The percentage of interventional trials registered by industry with nonspecific Intervention Name entries (attributable to four drug companies) decreased from 10 percent to 2 percent; all other industry and nonindustry records contained specific entries in this field. Of the 2670 studies registered by industry between the two dates, 76 percent provided information in the Primary Outcome Measure field, although these entries varied markedly in their degree of specificity. In the remaining 24 percent of the records, this field was blank.

CONCLUSIONS:During the summer of 2005, there were large increases in the number of clinical trial registrations. Overall, the data contained in records were more complete in October than they were in May, but there still is room for substantial improvement.},

abstract = {Epidemics of drug-resistant bacteria emerge worldwide, even as resistant strains frequently have reduced fitness compared to their drug-susceptible counterparts. Data from model systems suggest that the fitness cost of antimicrobial resistance can be reduced by compensatory mutations; however, there is limited evidence that compensatory evolution has any significant role in the success of drug-resistant bacteria in human populations. Here we describe a set of compensatory mutations in the RNA polymerase genes of rifampicin-resistant M. tuberculosis, the etiologic agent of human tuberculosis (TB). M. tuberculosis strains harboring these compensatory mutations showed a high competitive fitness in vitro. Moreover, these mutations were associated with high fitness in vivo, as determined by examining their relative clinical frequency across patient populations. Of note, in countries with the world's highest incidence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB, more than 30{\%} of MDR clinical isolates had this form of mutation. Our findings support a role for compensatory evolution in the global epidemics of MDR TB.},

However, the ability to sequence multitudes of bacterial genomes and deliver and interpret the resultant sequence information in near "real-time" is the basis of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. There have been numerous applications and successes of NGS applications in the clinical and public health domain. However, none have, as yet, delivered perhaps the most sought after application, i.e., the generation of microbial sequence data for "real-time" patient management. In this review, we discuss the use of NGS and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of microorganisms as a logical next step for the routine diagnosis of infection and the prediction of antimicrobial susceptibility in the clinical microbiology laboratory.},

abstract = {Responses by peripheral blood leukocytes may contribute to the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). We used DNA microarrays to reveal transcriptional patterns in the blood of 14 adults with DHF. Acute DHF was defined by an abundance of transcripts from cell cycle- and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related genes, suggesting a proliferative response accompanied by ER stress. Transcript-abundance levels for immunoresponse-associated genes, including cell surface markers, immunoglobulin, and innate response elements, were also elevated. Twenty-four genes were identified for which transcript abundance distinguished patients with dengue shock syndrome (DSS) from those without DSS. All the gene transcripts associated with DSS, many of which are induced by type I interferons, were less abundant in patients with DSS than in those without DSS. To our knowledge, these data provide the first snapshot of gene-expression patterns in peripheral blood during acute dengue and suggest that DSS is associated with attenuation of selected aspects of the innate host response.},

@article{Prabaker2011,
abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Antimicrobial resistance and a paucity of new antimicrobial agents are ongoing challenges. This review focuses on the major epidemiologic trends and novel treatments, when available, for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, Clostridium difficile, and multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli in the United States during 2010-2011. RECENT FINDINGS: MRSA bloodstream infection rates have declined, primarily due to interventions aimed at decreasing vascular catheter infections. The proportion of MRSA due to the community-associated strain USA300 continues to increase. Recent studies of active surveillance and contact isolation for MRSA prevention provide conflicting views of efficacy. Two novel treatments for recurrent C. difficile infection, monoclonal antibodies and fidaxomicin, show promising results. Antimicrobial resistance among Gram-negative bacilli has become widespread; extended-spectrum beta-lactamases are now commonly found among Escherichia coli causing community-acquired infections in the United States. Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases have spread beyond the northeast, and the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase has been reported in multiple countries within a few years of its discovery. SUMMARY: Antimicrobial resistance, particularly among Gram-negative bacilli, continues to increase at a rapid rate. Given the frequent transfer of patients between outpatient and acute care settings, as well as between different geographic regions, coordinated infection control interventions are warranted.},

abstract = {Seven chronically instrumented Yucatan minipigs were deeply sedated with the combination of ketamine (10 mg/kg), a dissociative anesthetic, and medetomidine (0.2 mg/kg), an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist used as an animal sedative in Europe. Both drugs were drawn in the same syringe and administered in the left atrium via a previously inserted permanent catheter. As a result, hypertension (mean arterial pressure from 116 +/- 12 mmHg to 142 +/- 18 mmHg) occurred and was followed by bradycardia (from 107 +/- 22 bpm to 71 +/- 9 bpm). Concomitantly, both the rate of increase in ventricular pressure (48{\%}) and ventricular wall thickening fraction (37{\%}) decreased, thus indicating some worsening of left ventricular function. Further, systemic vascular resistance increased (290{\%}) resulting in a reduction in cardiac output from 0.4 +/- 0.3 l/minute. Also, left ventricular end diastolic pressure initially increased (maximum 10.2 +/- 10.8 mmHg) but returned to the control level in 5 minutes. In spite of an increase in respiratory frequency (3x), PaCO2 increased and PaO2 and pH declined. Rectal temperature decreased from 38.4 +/- 0.9 to 36.0 +/- 0.8 degrees C. All of these changes were transient and returned to control levels during the follow-up period (2 hours). However, epinephrine concentration was exceptionally decreased by the drugs and stayed under the detection limit (20 pg/kg) for the entire time, whereas norepinephrine was undetectable for 10 minutes postadministration. Ketamine-medetomidine, administered in a dose that produced deep sedation, induced marked but reversible changes in most of the cardiovascular variables; there were no pedal or palpebral reflexes for 30 minutes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Timely information about disease severity can be central to the detection and management of outbreaks of acute respiratory infections (ARI), including influenza. We asked if two resources: 1) free text, and 2) structured data from an electronic medical record (EMR) could complement each other to identify patients with pneumonia, an ARI severity landmark.

METHODS: A manual EMR review of 2747 outpatient ARI visits with associated chest imaging identified x-ray reports that could support the diagnosis of pneumonia (kappa score  = 0.88 (95{\%} CI 0.82∶0.93)), along with attendant cases with Possible Pneumonia (adds either cough, sputum, fever/chills/night sweats, dyspnea or pleuritic chest pain) or with Pneumonia-in-Plan (adds pneumonia stated as a likely diagnosis by the provider). The x-ray reports served as a reference to develop a text classifier using machine-learning software that did not require custom coding. To identify pneumonia cases, the classifier was combined with EMR-based structured data and with text analyses aimed at ARI symptoms in clinical notes.

RESULTS: 370 reference cases with Possible Pneumonia and 250 with Pneumonia-in-Plan were identified. The x-ray report text classifier increased the positive predictive value of otherwise identical EMR-based case-detection algorithms by 20-70{\%}, while retaining sensitivities of 58-75{\%}. These performance gains were independent of the case definitions and of whether patients were admitted to the hospital or sent home. Text analyses seeking ARI symptoms in clinical notes did not add further value.

CONCLUSION: Specialized software development is not required for automated text analyses to help identify pneumonia patients. These results begin to map an efficient, replicable strategy through which EMR data can be used to stratify ARI severity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthritogenic mosquito-transmitted alphavirus that spread to the Caribbean in 2013 and to the US in 2014. CHIKV-infected patients develop inflammatory arthritis that can persist for months or years, but little is known about the rheumatologic and immunologic features of CHIKV-related arthritis in humans, particularly as compared to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The purpose of this study was to describe these features in a group of 10 American travelers who were nearly simultaneously infected while visiting Haiti in June 2014.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Patient history was obtained and physical examination and laboratory tests were performed. All patients with CHIKV-related arthritis had detectable levels of anti-CHIKV IgG. Using cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF), we analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells in CHIKV-infected patients, healthy controls, and patients with untreated, active RA.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Among 10 CHIKV-infected individuals, 8 developed persistent symmetric polyarthritis that met the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism 2010 criteria for (seronegative) RA. CyTOF analysis revealed that RA and CHIKV-infected patients had greater percentages of activated and effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cells than healthy controls.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: In addition to similar clinical features, patients with CHIKV infection and patients with RA develop very similar peripheral T cell phenotypes. These overlapping clinical and immunologic features highlight a need for rheumatologists to consider CHIKV infection when evaluating patients with new, symmetric polyarthritis.},

The propensity score allows one to design and analyze an observational (nonrandomized) study so that it mimics some of the particular characteristics of a randomized controlled trial. In particular, the propensity score is a balancing score: conditional on the propensity score, the distribution of observed baseline covariates will be similar between treated and untreated subjects. I describe 4 different propensity score methods: matching on the propensity score, stratification on the propensity score, inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score, and covariate adjustment using the propensity score. I describe balance diagnostics for examining whether the propensity score model has been adequately specified. Furthermore, I discuss differences between regression-based methods and propensity score-based methods for the analysis of observational data. I describe different causal average treatment effects and their relationship with propensity score analyses.},

abstract = {A total of 57 clinical isolates were screened by disk diffusion for a related pharmacodynamic study. Testing was performed using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines, except that results were interpreted at 16 to 18 h and 48 h. Of the 57 isolates, 19 were randomly chosen for additional comparative susceptibility testing of five methods (disk diffusion, Etest, Alamar colorimetric broth microdilution, Vitek, and MicroScan) and an in-house broth microdilution method. The two diffusion methods (disk and Etest) had the closest correlation. The commercial broth microdilution methods and the in-house microdilution method generated inconsistent results for all agents except trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Vitek compared poorly with both diffusion and microbroth dilution methods. The most significant discrepancies were evident with all methods when the incubation period was extended to 48 h. When results were interpreted at 48 h, the incidence of resistance for all bactericidal agents was approximately double the resistance observed at 16 to 18 h. The bacteriostatic agents, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and doxycycline, demonstrated the greatest in vitro activity and were least influenced by extended incubation with diffusion methods. Because correlative in vivo and in vitro studies have not revealed an effective therapeutic regimen for serious S. maltophilia infections, susceptibility results with all testing methods should be interpreted with caution when choosing therapy for patients with life-threatening infections. Susceptibility testing for this heterogeneous group remains controversial and routine testing, with the possible exception of doxycycline (or minocycline) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, should be avoided. Our data support that if testing is done with bactericidal agents, consideration should be given to interpretation after 48-h incubation.},

abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: While genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been successful in identifying novel variants associated with various diseases, it has been much more difficult to determine the biological mechanisms underlying these associations. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) provide another dimension to these data by associating single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with gene expression. We hypothesised that integrating SNPs known to be associated with type 2 diabetes with eQTLs and coexpression networks would enable the discovery of novel candidate genes for type 2 diabetes.

METHODS: We selected 32 SNPs associated with type 2 diabetes in two or more independent GWASs. We used previously described eQTLs mapped from genotype and gene expression data collected from 1,008 morbidly obese patients to find genes with expression associated with these SNPs. We linked these genes to coexpression modules, and ranked the other genes in these modules using an inverse sum score.

RESULTS: We found 62 genes with expression associated with type 2 diabetes SNPs. We validated our method by linking highly ranked genes in the coexpression modules back to SNPs through a combined eQTL dataset. We showed that the eQTLs highlighted by this method are significantly enriched for association with type 2 diabetes in data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC, p = 0.026) and the Gene Environment Association Studies (GENEVA, p = 0.042), validating our approach. Many of the highly ranked genes are also involved in the regulation or metabolism of insulin, glucose or lipids.

CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We have devised a novel method, involving the integration of datasets of different modalities, to discover novel candidate genes for type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {The ferret provides a unique model for the study of human influenza. The interaction between alveolar macrophages and virus strains with different levels of virulence was examined in vitro. The greater virulence of wild-type A strains over type B and C viruses was reflected in the higher production of infectious virus progeny and subsequent cytopathology, even though the expression of viral antigens was equivalent for all strains tested. These included A/Ann Arbor/6/60 (H2N2) and A/Rochester/1/82 (H3N2), B/Hong Kong/72, and C/Ann Arbor/1/50. The attenuated cold-adapted and temperature-sensitive variant of A/Ann Arbor/6/60 behaved like its parent except that a longer period was needed to reach peak viral release. In contrast, the avirulent host-range reassortant CR-43-3 did not productively replicate, though viral antigen expression was comparable to that of the other strains. Type C virus infected few cells and these continued to release low virus levels in the absence of detectable cytopathology. The results suggest that the ability of certain strains to infect and replicate in alveolar macrophages can be correlated to their in vivo virulence and may play a role in determining the course of viral pathogenesis.},

The prototype IFS system incorporates a novel method combining a simple microbial purification procedure with rapidin situidentification via spectroscopy. Results were available within 15 min of a bottle signaling positive and required no manual intervention. Among cultures positive for organisms contained within the database and producing acceptable spectra, 75 of 88 (85.2{\%}) and 79 of 88 (89.8{\%}) were correctly identified to the species and genus level, respectively. These results are similar to the performance of existing rapid methods.

@article{Zhu2007,
abstract = {To dissect common human diseases such as obesity and diabetes, a systematic approach is needed to study how genes interact with one another, and with genetic and environmental factors, to determine clinical end points or disease phenotypes. Bayesian networks provide a convenient framework for extracting relationships from noisy data and are frequently applied to large-scale data to derive causal relationships among variables of interest. Given the complexity of molecular networks underlying common human disease traits, and the fact that biological networks can change depending on environmental conditions and genetic factors, large datasets, generally involving multiple perturbations (experiments), are required to reconstruct and reliably extract information from these networks. With limited resources, the balance of coverage of multiple perturbations and multiple subjects in a single perturbation needs to be considered in the experimental design. Increasing the number of experiments, or the number of subjects in an experiment, is an expensive and time-consuming way to improve network reconstruction. Integrating multiple types of data from existing subjects might be more efficient. For example, it has recently been demonstrated that combining genotypic and gene expression data in a segregating population leads to improved network reconstruction, which in turn may lead to better predictions of the effects of experimental perturbations on any given gene. Here we simulate data based on networks reconstructed from biological data collected in a segregating mouse population and quantify the improvement in network reconstruction achieved using genotypic and gene expression data, compared with reconstruction using gene expression data alone. We demonstrate that networks reconstructed using the combined genotypic and gene expression data achieve a level of reconstruction accuracy that exceeds networks reconstructed from expression data alone, and that fewer subjects may be required to achieve this superior reconstruction accuracy. We conclude that this integrative genomics approach to reconstructing networks not only leads to more predictive network models, but also may save time and money by decreasing the amount of data that must be generated under any given condition of interest to construct predictive network models.},

abstract = {HIV-1 persists in peripheral blood monocytes in individuals receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with viral suppression, despite these cells being poorly susceptible to infection in vitro. Because very few monocytes harbor HIV-1 in vivo, we considered whether a subset of monocytes might be more permissive to infection. We show that a minor CD16+ monocyte subset preferentially harbors HIV-1 in infected individuals on HAART when compared with the majority of monocytes (CD14highCD16-). We confirmed this by in vitro experiments showing that CD16+ monocytes were more susceptible to CCR5-using strains of HIV-1, a finding that is associated with higher CCR5 expression on these cells. CD16+ monocytes were also more permissive to infection with a vesicular stomatitis virus G protein-pseudotyped reporter strain of HIV-1 than the majority of monocytes, suggesting that they are better able to support HIV-1 replication after entry. Consistent with this observation, high molecular mass complexes of apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G) were observed in CD16+ monocytes that were similar to those observed in highly permissive T cells. In contrast, CD14highCD16- monocytes contained low molecular mass active APOBEC3G, suggesting this is a mechanism of resistance to HIV-1 infection in these cells. Collectively, these data show that CD16+ monocytes are preferentially susceptible to HIV-1 entry, more permissive for replication, and constitute a continuing source of viral persistence during HAART.},

@article{Callaham2002,
abstract = {CONTEXT:Citation by other authors is important in the dissemination of published science, but factors predicting it are little studied.

METHODS:To identify characteristics of published research predicting citation in other journals, we searched the Science Citations Index database for a standardized 3.5 years for all citations of published articles originally submitted to a 1991 emergency medicine specialty meeting. Analysis was conducted by classification and regression trees, a nonparametric modeling technique of regression trees, to determine the impact of previously determined characteristics of the full articles on the outcome measures. We calculated the the number of times an article was cited each year and calculated the mean impact factor (citations per manuscript per year) in other citing journals.

RESULTS:Of the 493 submitted manuscripts, 204 published articles met entry criteria. The mean citations per year was 2.04 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.6-2.4; range, 0-20.9) in 440 different journals. Nineteen articles (9.3{\%}) were never cited. The ability to predict the citations per year was weak (pseudo R(2) = 0.14.). The strongest predictor of citations per year was the impact factor of the original publishing journal. The presence of a control group, the subjective newsworthiness score, and sample size predicted citation frequency (24.3{\%}, 26.0{\%}, and 26.5{\%} as strongly, respectively). The ability to predict mean impact factor of the citing journals was even weaker (pseudo R(2) = 0.09). The impact factor of the publishing journal was the strongest predictor, followed by the newsworthiness score (89.9{\%} as strongly) and a subjective quality score (61.5{\%}). Positive outcome bias was not evident for either outcome measure.

CONCLUSION:In this cohort of published research, commonly used measures of study methodology and design did not predict the frequency of citations or the importance of citing journals. Positive outcome bias was not evident. The impact factor of the original publishing journal was more important than any other variable, suggesting that the journal in which a study is published may be as important as traditional measures of study quality in ensuring dissemination.},

abstract = {Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthritogenic alphavirus causing epidemics of acute and chronic arthritic disease. Herein we describe a comprehensive RNA-Seq analysis of feet and lymph nodes at peak viraemia (day 2 post infection), acute arthritis (day 7) and chronic disease (day 30) in the CHIKV adult wild-type mouse model. Genes previously shown to be up-regulated in CHIKV patients were also up-regulated in the mouse model. CHIKV sequence information was also obtained with up to ≈8{\%} of the reads mapping to the viral genome; however, no adaptive viral genome changes were apparent. Although day 2, 7 and 30 represent distinct stages of infection and disease, there was a pronounced overlap in up-regulated host genes and pathways. Type I interferon response genes (IRGs) represented up to ≈50{\%} of up-regulated genes, even after loss of type I interferon induction on days 7 and 30. Bioinformatic analyses suggested a number of interferon response factors were primarily responsible for maintaining type I IRG induction. A group of genes prominent in the RNA-Seq analysis and hitherto unexplored in viral arthropathies were granzymes A, B and K. Granzyme A-/- and to a lesser extent granzyme K-/-, but not granzyme B-/-, mice showed a pronounced reduction in foot swelling and arthritis, with analysis of granzyme A-/- mice showing no reductions in viral loads but reduced NK and T cell infiltrates post CHIKV infection. Treatment with Serpinb6b, a granzyme A inhibitor, also reduced arthritic inflammation in wild-type mice. In non-human primates circulating granzyme A levels were elevated after CHIKV infection, with the increase correlating with viral load. Elevated granzyme A levels were also seen in a small cohort of human CHIKV patients. Taken together these results suggest granzyme A is an important driver of arthritic inflammation and a potential target for therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00281294.},

abstract = {The bacteria that can be grown in the laboratory are only a small fraction of the total diversity that exists in nature. At all levels of bacterial phylogeny, uncultured clades that do not grow on standard media are playing critical roles in cycling carbon, nitrogen, and other elements, synthesizing novel natural products, and impacting the surrounding organisms and environment. While molecular techniques, such as metagenomic sequencing, can provide some information independent of our ability to culture these organisms, it is essentially impossible to learn new gene and pathway functions from pure sequence data. A true understanding of the physiology of these bacteria and their roles in ecology, host health, and natural product production requires their cultivation in the laboratory. Recent advances in growing these species include coculture with other bacteria, recreating the environment in the laboratory, and combining these approaches with microcultivation technology to increase throughput and access rare species. These studies are unraveling the molecular mechanisms of unculturability and are identifying growth factors that promote the growth of previously unculturable organisms. This minireview summarizes the recent discoveries in this area and discusses the potential future of the field.},

Because continuously reported cases have been increasing since the summer of 2013, this novel virus poses a potential threat to public health in China and is attracting broad attention worldwide. In this review, we summarize and discuss the characteristics of the H7N9 virus revealed by the recent timely studies from the perspectives of epidemiology, host preference, clinical manifestations, immunopathogenesis, drug resistance, vaccine development, and burden of disease. This knowledge about the novel avian-origin H7N9 virus will provide a useful reference for clinical interventions of human infections and help to rapidly pave the way to develop an efficient and safe vaccine. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Dengue is the most prevalent mosquito-borne human illness worldwide. The ability to predict disease severity during the earliest days of the illness is a long-sought, but unachieved goal.We examined human genome-wide transcript abundance patterns in daily peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from 41 children hospitalized with dengue virus (DENV) infection in Nicaragua, as well as 8 healthy control subjects. Nine patients had primary dengue fever (DF1), 11 had dengue fever with serologic evidence of prior DENV infection, i.e., secondary dengue fever (DF2), 12 had dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and 9 had dengue shock syndrome (DSS). We identified 2,092 genes for which transcript abundance differed significantly between patients on days 3-6 of fever and healthy subjects (FDR{\textless}1{\%}). Prior DENV infection explained the greatest amount of variation in gene expression among patients. The number of differentially expressed genes was greatest on fever day 3 in patients with DF1, while the number in patients with DF2 or DHF/DSS was greatest on day 5. Genes associated with the mitotic cell cycle and B cell differentiation were expressed at higher levels, and genes associated with signal transduction and cell adhesion were expressed at lower levels, in patients versus healthy controls. On fever day 3, a set of interferon-stimulated gene transcripts was less abundant in patients who subsequently developed DSS than in other patient groups (p{\textless}0.05, ranksum). Patients who later developed DSS also had higher levels of transcripts on day 3 associated with mitochondrial function (p{\textless}0.01, ranksum). These day 3 transcript abundance findings were not evident on subsequent fever days.In conclusion, we identified differences in the timing and magnitude of human gene transcript abundance changes in DENV patients that were associated with serologic evidence of prior infection and with disease severity. Some of these differential features may predict the outcome of DENV infection.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED:Current web-based genome browsers require repetitious user input to scroll over long distances, alter the drawing density of elements or zoom through multiple orders of magnitude. Generally, either the server or the client is responsible for the majority of data processing, resulting in either servers having to receive and handle data relevant only to one user, or clients redundantly processing widely viewed data. ChromoZoom pre-renders and caches general-use tracks into tiled images on the server and serves them in an interactive web interface with inertial scrolling and precise, fluent zooming via the mouse wheel or trackpad. Custom tracks in several formats can be rendered by client-side code alongside the pre-rendered tracks, minimizing server load because of user-specific rendering and eliminating the need to transmit private data. ChromoZoom thereby enables rapid and simultaneous exploration of curated, experimental and personal genomic datasets.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:It has been thought that Clostridium difficile infection is transmitted predominantly within health care settings. However, endemic spread has hampered identification of precise sources of infection and the assessment of the efficacy of interventions. METHODS:From September 2007 through March 2011, we performed whole-genome sequencing on isolates obtained from all symptomatic patients with C. difficile infection identified in health care settings or in the community in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom. We compared single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) between the isolates, using C. difficile evolution rates estimated on the basis of the first and last samples obtained from each of 145 patients, with 0 to 2 SNVs expected between transmitted isolates obtained less than 124 days apart, on the basis of a 95{\%} prediction interval. We then identified plausible epidemiologic links among genetically related cases from data on hospital admissions and community location. RESULTS:Of 1250 C. difficile cases that were evaluated, 1223 (98{\%}) were successfully sequenced. In a comparison of 957 samples obtained from April 2008 through March 2011 with those obtained from September 2007 onward, a total of 333 isolates (35{\%}) had no more than 2 SNVs from at least 1 earlier case, and 428 isolates (45{\%}) had more than 10 SNVs from all previous cases. Reductions in incidence over time were similar in the two groups, a finding that suggests an effect of interventions targeting the transition from exposure to disease. Of the 333 patients with no more than 2 SNVs (consistent with transmission), 126 patients (38{\%}) had close hospital contact with another patient, and 120 patients (36{\%}) had no hospital or community contact with another patient. Distinct subtypes of infection continued to be identified throughout the study, which suggests a considerable reservoir of C. difficile. CONCLUSIONS:Over a 3-year period, 45{\%} of C. difficile cases in Oxfordshire were genetically distinct from all previous cases. Genetically diverse sources, in addition to symptomatic patients, play a major part in C. difficile transmission.

This potential for sequencing massive numbers of genomes calls for fully automated methods to produce high-quality assemblies and variant calls. We introduce Pilon, a fully automated, all-in-one tool for correcting draft assemblies and calling sequence variants of multiple sizes, including very large insertions and deletions. Pilon works with many types of sequence data, but is particularly strong when supplied with paired end data from two Illumina libraries with small e.g., 180 bp and large e.g., 3-5 Kb inserts. Pilon significantly improves draft genome assemblies by correcting bases, fixing mis-assemblies and filling gaps. For both haploid and diploid genomes, Pilon produces more contiguous genomes with fewer errors, enabling identification of more biologically relevant genes. Furthermore, Pilon identifies small variants with high accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art tools and is unique in its ability to accurately identify large sequence variants including duplications and resolve large insertions. Pilon is being used to improve the assemblies of thousands of new genomes and to identify variants from thousands of clinically relevant bacterial strains. Pilon is freely available as open source software.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic studies require precise phenotype definitions, but electronic medical record (EMR) phenotype data are recorded inconsistently and in a variety of formats. OBJECTIVE: To present lessons learned about validation of EMR-based phenotypes from the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The eMERGE network created and validated 13 EMR-derived phenotype algorithms. Network sites are Group Health, Marshfield Clinic, Mayo Clinic, Northwestern University, and Vanderbilt University. RESULTS: By validating EMR-derived phenotypes we learned that: (1) multisite validation improves phenotype algorithm accuracy; (2) targets for validation should be carefully considered and defined; (3) specifying time frames for review of variables eases validation time and improves accuracy; (4) using repeated measures requires defining the relevant time period and specifying the most meaningful value to be studied; (5) patient movement in and out of the health plan (transience) can result in incomplete or fragmented data; (6) the review scope should be defined carefully; (7) particular care is required in combining EMR and research data; (8) medication data can be assessed using claims, medications dispensed, or medications prescribed; (9) algorithm development and validation work best as an iterative process; and (10) validation by content experts or structured chart review can provide accurate results. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the diverse structure of the five EMRs of the eMERGE sites, we developed, validated, and successfully deployed 13 electronic phenotype algorithms. Validation is a worthwhile process that not only measures phenotype performance but also strengthens phenotype algorithm definitions and enhances their inter-institutional sharing.},

@article{Ding2013,
abstract = {UNLABELLED: To identify new candidate therapeutic targets for glioblastoma multiforme, we combined functional genetics and glioblastoma network modeling to identify kinases required for the growth of patient-derived brain tumor-initiating cells (BTIC) but that are dispensable to proliferating human neural stem cells (NSC). This approach yielded BUB1B/BUBR1, a critical mitotic spindle checkpoint player, as the top-scoring glioblastoma lethal kinase. Knockdown of BUB1B inhibited expansion of BTIC isolates, both in vitro and in vivo, without affecting proliferation of NSCs or astrocytes. Mechanistic studies revealed that BUB1B's GLE2p-binding sequence (GLEBS) domain activity is required to suppress lethal kinetochore-microtubule (KT-MT) attachment defects in glioblastoma isolates and genetically transformed cells with altered sister KT dynamics, which likely favor KT-MT instability. These results indicate that glioblastoma tumors have an added requirement for BUB1B to suppress lethal consequences of altered KT function and further suggest that sister KT measurements may predict cancer-specific sensitivity to BUB1B inhibition and perhaps other mitotic targets that affect KT-MT stability.

SIGNIFICANCE: Currently, no effective therapies are available for glioblastoma, the most frequent and aggressive brain tumor. Our results suggest that targeting the GLEBS domain activity of BUB1B may provide a therapeutic window for glioblastoma, as the GLEBS domain is nonessential in untransformed cells. Moreover, the results further suggest that sister KT distances at metaphase may predict sensitivity to anticancer therapeutics targeting KT function.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dengue virus infection causes an array of symptoms ranging from dengue fever (DF) to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The pathophysiological processes behind these 2 clinical manifestations are unclear.

METHOD: In the present study, genomewide transcriptomes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) collected from children with acute-phase DF (i.e., DF PBMCs) or acute-phase DHF (i.e., DHF PBMCs) were compared using microarray analysis. Results of genome screening were validated at the genomic and proteomics levels.

RESULTS: DHF had stronger influences on the gene expression profile than did DF. Of the affected genes, metabolic gene expression was influenced the most. For the immune response category, 17 genes were more strongly up-regulated in DF PBMCs than in DHF PBMCs. Eight of the these 17 genes were categorized as belonging to the interferon (IFN) system. The up-regulation of IFN-related genes was accompanied by strong expression of CD59, a complement inhibitor. DHF PBMCs expressed genes involved in T and B cell activation, cytokine production, complement activation, and T cell apoptosis more strongly than did DF PBMCs.

CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that, during DF, genes in the IFN system and complement inhibitor play a role in lowering virus production and reducing tissue damage. In patients with DHF, the dysfunction of immune cells, complement, and cytokines increases viral load and tissue damage.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The Glimmer gene-finding software has been successfully used for finding genes in bacteria, archaea and viruses representing hundreds of species. We describe several major changes to the Glimmer system, including improved methods for identifying both coding regions and start codons. We also describe a new module of Glimmer that can distinguish host and endosymbiont DNA. This module was developed in response to the discovery that eukaryotic genome sequencing projects sometimes inadvertently capture the DNA of intracellular bacteria living in the host.

RESULTS: The new methods dramatically reduce the rate of false-positive predictions, while maintaining Glimmer's 99{\%} sensitivity rate at detecting genes in most species, and they find substantially more correct start sites, as measured by comparisons to known and well-curated genes. We show that our interpolated Markov model (IMM) DNA discriminator correctly separated 99{\%} of the sequences in a recent genome project that produced a mixture of sequences from the bacterium Prochloron didemni and its sea squirt host, Lissoclinum patella.

@article{Goodman1999a,
abstract = {An important problem exists in the interpretation of modern medical research data: Biological understanding and previous research play little formal role in the interpretation of quantitative results. This phenomenon is manifest in the discussion sections of research articles and ultimately can affect the reliability of conclusions. The standard statistical approach has created this situation by promoting the illusion that conclusions can be produced with certain "error rates," without consideration of information from outside the experiment. This statistical approach, the key components of which are P values and hypothesis tests, is widely perceived as a mathematically coherent approach to inference. There is little appreciation in the medical community that the methodology is an amalgam of incompatible elements, whose utility for scientific inference has been the subject of intense debate among statisticians for almost 70 years. This article introduces some of the key elements of that debate and traces the appeal and adverse impact of this methodology to the P value fallacy, the mistaken idea that a single number can capture both the long-run outcomes of an experiment and the evidential meaning of a single result. This argument is made as a prelude to the suggestion that another measure of evidence should be used--the Bayes factor, which properly separates issues of long-run behavior from evidential strength and allows the integration of background knowledge with statistical findings.},

abstract = {The availability of the human genome sequence has allowed identification of disease-causing mutations in many Mendelian disorders, and detection of significant associations of nucleotide polymorphisms to complex diseases and traits. Despite these progresses, finding the causative variations for most of the common diseases remains a complex task. Several studies have shown gene expression analyses provide a quite unbiased way to investigate complex traits and common disorders' pathogenesis. Therefore, whole-transcriptome analysis is increasingly acquiring a key role in the knowledge of mechanisms responsible for complex diseases. Hybridization-and tag-based technologies have elucidated the involvement of multiple genes and pathways in pathological conditions, providing insights into the expression of thousand of coding and noncoding RNAs, such as microRNAs. However, the introduction of Next-Generation Sequencing, particularly of RNA-Seq, has overcome some drawbacks of previously used technologies. Identifying, in a single experiment, potentially novel genes/exons and splice isoforms, RNA editing, fusion transcripts and allele-specific expression are some of its advantages. RNA-Seq has been fruitfully applied to study cancer and host-pathogens interactions, and it is taking first steps for studying neurodegenerative diseases (ND) as well as neuropsychiatric diseases. In addition, it is emerging as a very powerful tool to study quantitative trait loci associated with gene expression in complex diseases. This paper provides an overview on gene expression profiling of complex diseases, with emphasis on RNA-Seq, its advantages over conventional technologies for studying cancer and ND, and for linking nucleotide variations to gene expression changes, also discussing its limitations.},

abstract = {In vitro infection with dengue virus induces interleukin (IL)-8 secretion, which increases endothelial cell permeability; this has been proposed as a mechanism for plasma leakage in dengue hemorrhagic fever. We studied the mechanisms of IL-8 induction, using luciferase reporter constructs, and the effect of pharmacological inhibitors of either IL-8 secretion or nuclear factor- kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation on IL-8 induction by dengue 2 virus (DEN2V) infection. IL-8 induction by DEN2V infection was associated with activation of NF- kappa B and activator protein-1 (AP-1) in HEK293A cells but only with activation of AP-1 in HepG2 cells. Treatment with SB203580, a mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor, and rolipram, a phosphodiesterase IV inhibitor, partially inhibited DEN2V-induced IL-8 secretion in HEK293A cells but increased DEN2V-induced IL-8 secretion in HepG2 cells. In contrast, treatment with dexamethasone increased DEN2V-induced IL-8 secretion in HEK293A cells but had no effect on DEN2V-induced IL-8 secretion in HepG2 cells. These results demonstrate that anti-inflammatory drugs have variable effects on IL-8 secretion in different cell types during DEN2V infection.},

GyrA (Leu-55 to Gln-155, Escherichia coli numbering), GyrB (Met-391 to Phe-513), ParC (Ile-34 to Arg-124), and ParE (Leu-396 to Leu-567) fragments from strain ATCC 13637 showed high degrees of identity to the corresponding regions from the phytopathogen Xylella fastidiosa, with the degrees of identity ranging from 85.0 to 93.5{\%}. Lower degrees of identity to the corresponding regions from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (70.9 to 88.6{\%}) and E. coli (73.0 to 88.6{\%}) were observed. Amino acid changes were present in GyrA fragments from 9 of the 32 strains at positions 70, 85, 90, 103, 112, 113, 119, and 124; but there was no consistent relation to higher ciprofloxacin MICs. The absence of changes at positions 83 and 87, commonly involved in quinolone resistance in gram-negative bacteria, was unexpected. The GyrB sequences were identical in all strains, and only one strain (ciprofloxacin MIC, 16 microg/ml) showed a ParC amino acid change (Ser-80--{\textgreater}Arg). In contrast, a high frequency (16 of 32 strains) of amino acid replacements was present in ParE. The frequencies of alterations at positions 437, 465, 477, and 485 were higher (P {\textless} 0.05) in strains from cystic fibrosis patients, but these changes were not linked with high ciprofloxacin MICs. An efflux phenotype, screened by the detection of decreases of at least twofold doubling dilutions of the ciprofloxacin MIC in the presence of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (0.5 microg/ml) or reserpine (10 microg/ml), was suspected in seven strains. These results suggest that topoisomerases II and IV may not be the primary targets involved in quinolone resistance in S. maltophilia.},

abstract = {Avian influenza viruses replicate in a variety of mammals and birds, yet hemagglutination inhibition tests show that postinfection sera from these animals (e.g., ferrets and ducks) have insignificant levels of antibodies (Hinshaw et al., Infect. Immun. 34:354-361, 1981). This suggested that avian influenza viruses, in contrast to mammalian viruses, may not induce a significant humoral response. Studies reported here indicate that avian influenza viruses do induce high levels of antibodies in ferrets, ducks, and mice and produce long-lived memory for cytotoxic T-cells in mice. The failure to detect hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies to avian viruses was explained by the finding that antibodies to avian influenza viruses were not detectable in hemagglutination inhibition tests with intact virus yet were readily demonstrable when hemagglutinin subunits were used. In addition, these sera contained high levels of neutralizing antibodies to the avian virus. These findings suggest that the hemagglutinins of avian and mammalian influenza viruses may differ in their accessibility to antibodies or the biological consequence of antibody attachment or both. The practical consequence of these studies is that hemagglutination inhibition tests with intact avian viruses fail to detect antibody and do not correlate with virus neutralization. The avian virus used in these studies, A/Mallard/NY/6870/78 (H2N2), replicated and caused mortality in BALB/c mice, emphasizing that the host range and virulence of avian viruses extends to mammals. The above findings suggest that avian viruses could infect mammals in nature, yet seroepidemiological studies with conventional hemagglutination inhibition tests could give misleading results.},

In the present study 198 clinical isolates, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 146), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 25), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 27) were evaluated. Reference susceptibility testing of cefepime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, meropenem, piperacillin, tobramycin, levofloxacin (only for P. aeruginosa), co-trimoxazole (only for S. maltophilia), and ampicillin-sulbactam and tetracycline (only for A. baumannii) was performed by microdilution (NCCLS guidelines). The VITEK 2 system correctly identified 91.6, 100, and 76{\%} of P. aeruginosa, S. maltophilia, and A. baumannii isolates, respectively, within 3 h. The respective percentages of essential agreement (to within 1 twofold dilution) for P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii were 89.0 and 88.0{\%} (cefepime), 91.1 and 100{\%} (cefotaxime), 95.2 and 96.0{\%} (ceftazidime), 98.6 and 100{\%} (ciprofloxacin), 88.4 and 100{\%} (gentamicin), 87.0 and 92.0{\%} (imipenem), 85.0 and 88.0{\%} (meropenem), 84.2 and 96.0{\%} (piperacillin), and 97.3 and 80{\%} (tobramycin). The essential agreement for levofloxacin against P. aeruginosa was 86.3{\%}. The percentages of essential agreement for ampicillin-sulbactam and tetracycline against A. baumannii were 88.0 and 100{\%}, respectively. Very major errors for P. aeruginosa (resistant by the reference method, susceptible with the VITEK 2 system [resistant to susceptible]) were noted for cefepime (0.7{\%}), cefotaxime (0.7{\%}), gentamicin (0.7{\%}), imipenem (1.4{\%}), levofloxacin (2.7{\%}), and piperacillin (2.7{\%}) and, for one strain of A. baumannii, for imipenem. Major errors (susceptible to resistant) were noted only for P. aeruginosa and cefepime (2.0{\%}), ceftazidime (0.7{\%}), and piperacillin (3.4{\%}). Minor errors ranged from 0.0{\%} for piperacillin to 22.6{\%} for cefotaxime against P. aeruginosa and from 0.0{\%} for piperacillin and ciprofloxacin to 20.0{\%} for cefepime against A. baumannii. The VITEK 2 system provided co-trimoxazole MICs only for S. maltophilia; no very major or major errors were obtained for co-trimoxazole against this species. It is concluded that the VITEK 2 system allows the rapid identification of S. maltophilia and most P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates. The VITEK 2 system can perform reliable susceptibility testing of many of the antimicrobial agents used against P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. It would be desirable if new versions of the VITEK 2 software were able to determine MICs and the corresponding clinical categories of agents active against S. maltophilia.},

abstract = {Bacterial whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of human pathogens has provided unprecedented insights into the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Most studies have focused on identification of resistance mutations, leaving one to speculate on the fate of these mutants once the antibiotic selective pressure is removed. We performed WGS on longitudinal isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii from patients undergoing colistin treatment, and upon subsequent drug withdrawal. In each of the four patients, colistin resistance evolved via mutations at the pmr locus. Upon colistin withdrawal, an ancestral susceptible strain outcompeted resistant isolates in three of the four cases. In the final case, resistance was also lost, but by a com- pensatory inactivating mutation in the transcriptional regulator of the pmr locus. Notably, this inactivating mutation reduced the probability of reacquiring colistin resistance when subsequently challenged in vitro. On face value, these results supported an in vivo fitness cost preventing the evolution of stable colistin resistance. However, more careful analysis of WGS data identified genomic evidence for stable colistin resistance undetected by clinical microbiological assays. Transcriptional studies validated this genomic hypothesis, showing increased pmr expression of the initial isolate. Moreover, altering the environmental growth conditions of the clinical assay recapitulated the classification as colistin resistant. Additional targeted sequencing revealed that this isolate evolved undetected in a patient undergoing colistin treatment, and was then transmitted to other hospitalized patients, further demonstrating its stability in the absence of colistin. This study provides a unique window into mutational pathways taken in response to antibiotic pressure in vivo, and demonstrates the potential for genome sequence data to predict resistance phenotypes.},

Central to the success of SCILHS is development of innovative 'apps' to improve PCOR research methods and capacitate point of care functions such as consent, enrollment, randomization, and outreach for patient-reported outcomes. SCILHS adapts and extends an existing national research network formed on an advanced IT infrastructure built with open source, free, modular components.},

This kind of approach cannot always expose the interconnecting pathways that control immune-system responses and does not reveal how the immune system works across multiple biological systems and scales. High-throughput technologies can be used to measure thousands of parameters of the immune system at a genome-wide scale. These system-wide surveys yield massive amounts of quantitative data that provide a means to monitor and probe immune-system function. New integrative analyses can help synthesize and transform these data into valuable biological insight.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: New methods are needed to improve health behaviors, such as adherence to colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. Personalized genetic information to guide medical decisions is increasingly available. Whether such information motivates behavioral change is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether individualized genetic and environmental risk assessment (GERA) of CRC susceptibility improves adherence to screening in average-risk persons. DESIGN: 2-group, randomized, controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT0087360). SETTING: 4 medical school-affiliated primary care practices. PARTICIPANTS: 783 participants at average risk for CRC who were not adherent to screening at study entry. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to usual care or GERA, which evaluated methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphisms and serum folate levels. On the basis of prespecified combinations of polymorphisms and serum folate levels, GERA recipients were told that they were at elevated or average risk for CRC. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was CRC screening within 6 months of study entry. RESULTS: Overall screening rates for CRC did not statistically significant differ between the usual care (35.7{\%}) and GERA (33.1{\%}) groups. After adjustment for baseline participant factors, the odds ratio for screening completion for GERA versus usual care was 0.88 (95{\%} CI, 0.64 to 1.22). Within the GERA group, screening rates did not significantly differ between average-risk (38.1{\%}) and elevated-risk (26.9{\%}) participants. Odds ratios for elevated- versus average-risk participants remained nonsignificant after adjustment for covariates (odds ratio, 0.75 [CI, 0.39 to 1.42]). LIMITATION: Only 1 personalized genetic and environmental interaction and 1 health behavior (CRC screening) were assessed. CONCLUSION: In average-risk persons, CRC screening uptake was not positively associated with feedback from a single personalized GERA. Additional studies will be required to evaluate whether other approaches to providing GERA affect screening utilization differently. These findings raise concern about the effectiveness of moderately predictive assessment of genetic risk to promote favorable health care behavior.

abstract = {We report on the cloning of the gene smeT, which encodes the transcriptional regulator of the Stenotrophomonas maltophilia efflux pump SmeDEF. SmeT belongs to the TetR and AcrR family of transcriptional regulators. The smeT gene is located upstream from the structural operon of the pump genes smeDEF and is divergently transcribed from those genes. Experiments with S. maltophilia and the heterologous host Escherichia coli have demonstrated that SmeT is a transcriptional repressor. S1 nuclease mapping has demonstrated that expression of smeT is driven by a single promoter lying close to the 5' end of the gene and that expression of smeDEF is driven by an unique promoter that overlaps with promoter PSMET: The level of expression of smeT is higher in smeDEF-overproducing S. maltophilia strain D457R, which suggests that SmeT represses its own expression. Band-shifting assays have shown that wild-type strain S. maltophilia D457 contains a cellular factor(s) capable of binding to the intergenic smeT-smeD region. That cellular factor(s) was absent from smeDEF-overproducing S. maltophilia strain D457R. The sequence of smeT from D457R showed a point mutation that led to a Leu166Gln change within the SmeT protein. This change allowed overexpression of both smeDEF and smeT in D457R. It was noteworthy that expression of wild-type SmeT did not fully complement the smeT mutation in D457R. This suggests that the wild-type protein is not dominant over the mutant SmeT.},

@article{Goff2011,
abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Antibiotic resistance continues to rise, whereas development of new agents to counter it has slowed. A heightened need exists to maintain the effectiveness of currently available agents. This review focuses on the need for better antimicrobial stewardship, expected benefits of well designed antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs), and provides suggestions for development of an effective ASP. RECENT FINDINGS: Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a significant cause of poor treatment outcomes and elevated healthcare and societal costs worldwide. HAIs are often caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens; overuse of antibiotics has been linked with antibiotic resistance. Benefits of improved antimicrobial stewardship include reduced emergence of antibiotic resistance, limitation of drug-related adverse events, minimization of other consequences of antibiotic use (e.g., superinfection), and reduction of societal and healthcare-related costs. In 2007, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) provided guidelines for the development of institutional programs to enhance antimicrobial stewardship. Experiences at The Ohio State University Medical Center (OSUMC) reinforce this message, while providing specific examples of ways to optimize ASP development and implementation. The focus of an ASP should be on improving quality of care, reducing drug resistance, and cost savings. When implementing an ASP, it is important to identify those most likely to resist the ASP, understand their concerns, and develop easy-to-understand messages that address these concerns and highlight the benefits of the proposed changes. Antibiograms play a key role in identifying local and interdepartmental trends in antibiotic susceptibility or resistance. These data are important not only in devising best-treatment practices for the institution, but also in evaluating the impact of a recently implemented ASP. Other measures of the impact of an ASP should include patient outcomes and overall costs or savings. SUMMARY: Better antimicrobial stewardship is needed to limit the emergence of antibiotic resistance, prolong the effectiveness of currently available agents, improve patient outcomes, and reduce healthcare and societal costs associated with HAIs. Guidelines from the IDSA/SHEA and experiences at OSUMC provide examples of how best to develop an institutional ASP to accomplish these goals.},

Small-molecule metabolites are one category of critical cellular intermediates that can influence as well as be a target of cellular regulations. Because metabolites represent the direct output of protein-mediated cellular processes, endogenous metabolite concentrations can closely reflect cellular physiological states, especially when integrated with other molecular-profiling data. Here we develop and apply a network reconstruction approach that simultaneously integrates six different types of data: endogenous metabolite concentration, RNA expression, DNA variation, DNA-protein binding, protein-metabolite interaction, and protein-protein interaction data, to construct probabilistic causal networks that elucidate the complexity of cell regulation in a segregating yeast population. Because many of the metabolites are found to be under strong genetic control, we were able to employ a causal regulator detection algorithm to identify causal regulators of the resulting network that elucidated the mechanisms by which variations in their sequence affect gene expression and metabolite concentrations. We examined all four expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) hot spots with colocalized metabolite QTLs, two of which recapitulated known biological processes, while the other two elucidated novel putative biological mechanisms for the eQTL hot spots.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: RNA-Seq is a promising new technology for accurately measuring gene expression levels. Expression estimation with RNA-Seq requires the mapping of relatively short sequencing reads to a reference genome or transcript set. Because reads are generally shorter than transcripts from which they are derived, a single read may map to multiple genes and isoforms, complicating expression analyses. Previous computational methods either discard reads that map to multiple locations or allocate them to genes heuristically. RESULTS: We present a generative statistical model and associated inference methods that handle read mapping uncertainty in a principled manner. Through simulations parameterized by real RNA-Seq data, we show that our method is more accurate than previous methods. Our improved accuracy is the result of handling read mapping uncertainty with a statistical model and the estimation of gene expression levels as the sum of isoform expression levels. Unlike previous methods, our method is capable of modeling non-uniform read distributions. Simulations with our method indicate that a read length of 20-25 bases is optimal for gene-level expression estimation from mouse and maize RNA-Seq data when sequencing throughput is fixed.},

abstract = {Hospital-associated infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are a global health burden dominated by a small number of bacterial clones. The pandemic EMRSA-16 clone (ST36-II) has been widespread in UK hospitals for 20 y, but its evolutionary origin and the molecular basis for its hospital association are unclear. We carried out a Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction on the basis of the genome sequences of 87 S. aureus isolates including 60 EMRSA-16 and 27 additional clonal complex 30 (CC30) isolates, collected from patients in three continents over a 53-y period. The three major pandemic clones to originate from the CC30 lineage, including phage type 80/81, Southwest Pacific, and EMRSA-16, shared a most recent common ancestor that existed over 100 y ago, whereas the hospital-associated EMRSA-16 clone is estimated to have emerged about 35 y ago. Our CC30 genome-wide analysis revealed striking molecular correlates of hospital- or community-associated pandemics represented by mobile genetic elements and nonsynonymous mutations affecting antibiotic resistance and virulence. Importantly, phylogeographic analysis indicates that EMRSA-16 spread within the United Kingdom by transmission from hospitals in large population centers in London and Glasgow to regional health-care settings, implicating patient referrals as an important cause of nationwide transmission. Taken together, the high-resolution phylogenomic approach used resulted in a unique understanding of the emergence and transmission of a major MRSA clone and provided molecular correlates of its hospital adaptation. Similar approaches for hospital-associated clones of other bacterial pathogens may inform appropriate measures for controlling their intra- and interhospital spread.},

abstract = {Accurate and rapid identification of perturbed pathways through the analysis of genome-wide expression profiles facilitates the generation of biological hypotheses. We propose a statistical framework for determining whether a specified group of genes for a pathway has a coordinated association with a phenotype of interest. Several issues on proper hypothesis-testing procedures are clarified. In particular, it is shown that the differences in the correlation structure of each set of genes can lead to a biased comparison among gene sets unless a normalization procedure is applied. We propose statistical tests for two important but different aspects of association for each group of genes. This approach has more statistical power than currently available methods and can result in the discovery of statistically significant pathways that are not detected by other methods. This method is applied to data sets involving diabetes, inflammatory myopathies, and Alzheimer's disease, using gene sets we compiled from various public databases. In the case of inflammatory myopathies, we have correctly identified the known cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated autoimmunity in inclusion body myositis. Furthermore, we predicted the presence of dendritic cells in inclusion body myositis and of an IFN-alpha/beta response in dermatomyositis, neither of which was previously described. These predictions have been subsequently corroborated by immunohistochemistry.},

An integrative approach to modeling that combines diverse mathematics enabled the simultaneous inclusion of fundamentally different cellular processes and experimental measurements. Our whole-cell model accounts for all annotated gene functions and was validated against a broad range of data. The model provides insights into many previously unobserved cellular behaviors, including in vivo rates of protein-DNA association and an inverse relationship between the durations of DNA replication initiation and replication. In addition, experimental analysis directed by model predictions identified previously undetected kinetic parameters and biological functions.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis result from alterations in intestinal microbes and the immune system. However, the precise dysfunctions of microbial metabolism in the gastrointestinal microbiome during IBD remain unclear. We analyzed the microbiota of intestinal biopsies and stool samples from 231 IBD and healthy subjects by 16S gene pyrosequencing and followed up a subset using shotgun metagenomics. Gene and pathway composition were assessed, based on 16S data from phylogenetically-related reference genomes, and associated using sparse multivariate linear modeling with medications, environmental factors, and IBD status. RESULTS: Firmicutes and Enterobacteriaceae abundances were associated with disease status as expected, but also with treatment and subject characteristics. Microbial function, though, was more consistently perturbed than composition, with 12{\%} of analyzed pathways changed compared with 2{\%} of genera. We identified major shifts in oxidative stress pathways, as well as decreased carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis in favor of nutrient transport and uptake. The microbiome of ileal Crohn's disease was notable for increases in virulence and secretion pathways. CONCLUSIONS: This inferred functional metagenomic information provides the first insights into community-wide microbial processes and pathways that underpin IBD pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Dengue virus is a single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus that productively infects human dendritic cells (DCs) primarily at the immature stage of their differentiation. We now find that all four serotypes of dengue use DC-SIGN (CD209), a C-type lectin, to infect dendritic cells. THP-1 cells become susceptible to dengue infection after transfection of DC-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), or its homologue L-SIGN, whereas the infection of dendritic cells is blocked by anti-DC-SIGN antibodies and not by antibodies to other molecules on these cells. Viruses produced by dendritic cells are infectious for DC-SIGN- and L-SIGN-bearing THP-1 cells and other permissive cell lines. Therefore, DC-SIGN may be considered as a new target for designing therapies that block dengue infection.},

Over the past 2 years, the pre-existing influenza and Dengue virus resources have been combined into a single construct and West Nile virus added to the resultant resource. A number of improvements were incorporated into the sequence annotation and database loading pipelines, and the virus-specific search interfaces were updated to support more advanced functions. Several new features have also been added to the sequence download options, and a new multiple sequence alignment viewer has been incorporated into the resource tool set. Together these enhancements should support enhanced usability and the inclusion of new viruses in the future.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Identification of antimicrobial resistance genes is important for understanding the underlying mechanisms and the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance. As the costs of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) continue to decline, it becomes increasingly available in routine diagnostic laboratories and is anticipated to substitute traditional methods for resistance gene identification. Thus, the current challenge is to extract the relevant information from the large amount of generated data. METHODS: We developed a web-based method, ResFinder that uses BLAST for identification of acquired antimicrobial resistance genes in whole-genome data. As input, the method can use both pre-assembled, complete or partial genomes, and short sequence reads from four different sequencing platforms. The method was evaluated on 1862 GenBank files containing 1411 different resistance genes, as well as on 23 de-novo-sequenced isolates. RESULTS: When testing the 1862 GenBank files, the method identified the resistance genes with an ID = 100{\%} (100{\%} identity) to the genes in ResFinder. Agreement between in silico predictions and phenotypic testing was found when the method was further tested on 23 isolates of five different bacterial species, with available phenotypes. Furthermore, ResFinder was evaluated on WGS chromosomes and plasmids of 30 isolates. Seven of these isolates were annotated to have antimicrobial resistance, and in all cases, annotations were compatible with the ResFinder results. CONCLUSIONS: A web server providing a convenient way of identifying acquired antimicrobial resistance genes in completely sequenced isolates was created. ResFinder can be accessed at www.genomicepidemiology.org. ResFinder will continuously be updated as new resistance genes are identified.},

abstract = {Dengue fever is the most frequent arthropod-borne viral disease of humans, with almost half of the world's population at risk of infection. The high prevalence, lack of an effective vaccine, and absence of specific treatment conspire to make dengue fever a global public health threat. Given their compact genomes, dengue viruses (DENV-1-4) and other flaviviruses probably require an extensive number of host factors; however, only a limited number of human, and an even smaller number of insect host factors, have been identified. Here we identify insect host factors required for DENV-2 propagation, by carrying out a genome-wide RNA interference screen in Drosophila melanogaster cells using a well-established 22,632 double-stranded RNA library. This screen identified 116 candidate dengue virus host factors (DVHFs). Although some were previously associated with flaviviruses (for example, V-ATPases and alpha-glucosidases), most of the DVHFs were newly implicated in dengue virus propagation. The dipteran DVHFs had 82 readily recognizable human homologues and, using a targeted short-interfering-RNA screen, we showed that 42 of these are human DVHFs. This indicates notable conservation of required factors between dipteran and human hosts. This work suggests new approaches to control infection in the insect vector and the mammalian host.},

We identified 121 common genetic variants associated in cis with variation in expression responses to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, influenza, or interferon-$\beta$ (IFN-$\beta$). We localized and validated causal variants to binding sites of pathogen-activated STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) and IRF (IFN-regulatory factor) transcription factors. We also identified a common variant in IRF7 that is associated in trans with type I IFN induction in response to influenza infection. Our results reveal common alleles that explain interindividual variation in pathogen sensing and provide functional annotation for genetic variants that alter susceptibility to inflammatory diseases.},

abstract = {Stenotrophomonas maltophilia colonization/infection in patients with cancer has significantly increased over the past 2 decades. Patients with prolonged neutropenia, exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics, and those requiring mechanical ventilation have higher risk of infection. These micro-organisms are intrinsically resistant to carbapenems, and exposure to these agents has been linked to selection of S. maltophilia. Recently, these infections are being documented in patients without traditional risk factors. The spectrum of infection includes bacteremia, catheter-related infection, pneumonia, complicated biliary and urinary tract infection, and skin and skin-structure infection. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the therapeutic agent of choice, but resistance is increasingly being reported. Susceptibility to alternative agents is unpredictable. Combination therapy and alternative routes of drug administration, such as aerosolized aminoglycoside, might be necessary. New insights into the mechanisms of drug resistance might lead to identification of new target sites. Agents that improve outer-membrane permeability and broad-spectrum beta-lactamase inhibitors may favorably impact difficult-to-treat (i.e., multidrug resistant) S. maltophilia infections.},

abstract = {The four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) cause dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Severe disease has been associated with heterotypic secondary DENV infection, mediated by cross-reactive antibodies (Abs) and/or cross-reactive T cells. The role of cross-reactive immunity in mediating enhanced disease versus cross-protection against secondary heterotypic DENV infection is not well defined. A better understanding of the cross-reactive immune response in natural infections is critical for development of safe and effective tetravalent vaccines. We studied the B cell phenotype of circulating B cells in the blood of pediatric patients suspected of dengue during the 2010-2011 dengue season in Managua, Nicaragua (n = 216), which was dominated by the DENV-3 serotype. We found a markedly larger percentage of plasmablast/plasma cells (PB/PCs) circulating in DENV-positive patients as compared to patients with Other Febrile Illnesses (OFIs). The percentage of DENV-specific PB/PCs against DENV-3 represented 10{\%} of the circulating antibody-producing cells (ASCs) in secondary DENV-3 infections. Importantly, the cross-reactive DENV-specific B cell response was higher against a heterotypic serotype, with 46{\%} of circulating PB/PCs specific to DENV-2 and 10{\%} specific to DENV-3 during acute infection. We also observed a higher cross-reactive DENV-specific IgG serum avidity directed against DENV-2 as compared to DENV-3 during acute infection. The neutralization capacity of the serum was broadly cross-reactive against the four DENV serotypes both during the acute phase and at 3 months post-onset of symptoms. Overall, the cross-reactive B cell immune response dominates during secondary DENV infections in humans. These results reflect our recent findings in a mouse model of DENV cross-protection. In addition, this study enabled the development of increased technical and research capacity of Nicaraguan scientists and the implementation of several new immunological assays in the field.},

These must be capable of the storage, retrieval, and analysis of linked phenotypic and genotypic information in an accessible, scalable and computationally efficient manner.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The Bacterial Isolate Genome Sequence Database (BIGSDB) is a scalable, open source, web-accessible database system that meets these needs, enabling phenotype and sequence data, which can range from a single sequence read to whole genome data, to be efficiently linked for a limitless number of bacterial specimens. The system builds on the widely used mlstdbNet software, developed for the storage and distribution of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) data, and incorporates the capacity to define and identify any number of loci and genetic variants at those loci within the stored nucleotide sequences. These loci can be further organised into 'schemes' for isolate characterisation or for evolutionary or functional analyses. Isolates and loci can be indexed by multiple names and any number of alternative schemes can be accommodated, enabling cross-referencing of different studies and approaches. LIMS functionality of the software enables linkage to and organisation of laboratory samples. The data are easily linked to external databases and fine-grained authentication of access permits multiple users to participate in community annotation by setting up or contributing to different schemes within the database. Some of the applications of BIGSDB are illustrated with the genera Neisseria and Streptococcus.The BIGSDB source code and documentation are available at http://pubmlst.org/software/database/bigsdb/.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Genomic data can be used to characterise bacterial isolates in many different ways but it can also be efficiently exploited for evolutionary or functional studies.

Collectively, better tools, well-characterized parts and a comprehensive understanding of how to compose circuits are leading to a breakthrough in the ability to program living cells for advanced applications, from living therapeutics to the atomic manufacturing of functional materials.},

abstract = {Identifying emerging viral pathogens and characterizing their transmission is essential to developing effective public health measures in response to an epidemic. Phylogenetics, though currently the most popular tool used to characterize the likely host of a virus, can be ambiguous when studying species very distant to known species and when there is very little reliable sequence information available in the early stages of the outbreak of disease. Motivated by an existing framework for representing biological sequence information, we learn sparse, tree-structured models, built from decision rules based on subsequences, to predict viral hosts from protein sequence data using popular discriminative machine learning tools. Furthermore, the predictive motifs robustly selected by the learning algorithm are found to show strong host-specificity and occur in highly conserved regions of the viral proteome.},

abstract = {Long-read sequencing technologies have potential to produce gold-standard de novo genome assemblies, but fully exploiting error-prone reads to resolve repeats remains a challenge. Aggressive approaches to repeat resolution often produce mis-assemblies, and conservative approaches lead to unnecessary fragmentation. We present HINGE, an assembler that achieves optimal repeat resolution by distinguishing repeats that can be resolved given the data from those that cannot. This is accomplished by adding "hinges" to reads for constructing an overlap graph where only unresolvable repeats are merged. As a result, HINGE combines the error resilience of overlap-based assemblers with repeat-resolution capabilities of de Bruijn graph assemblers. HINGE was evaluated on the long-read datasets from the NCTC project. Besides producing more finished assemblies than the manual pipeline of NCTC based on the HGAP assembler and Circlator, HINGE allows us to identify 40 datasets where unresolvable repeats prevent the reliable construction of a unique finished assembly. In these cases, HINGE outputs a visually interpretable assembly graph that encodes all possible finished assemblies consistent with the reads, while other approaches either fragment the assembly or resolve the ambiguity arbitrarily.},

abstract = {Insulin resistance is one of the dominant symptoms of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Although the molecular mechanisms leading to this resistance are largely unknown, experimental data support that the insulin signaling pathway is impaired in patients who are insulin resistant. To identify novel components/modulators of the insulin signaling pathway, we designed siRNAs targeting over 300 genes and tested the effects of knocking down these genes in an insulin-dependent, anti-lipolysis assay in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. For 126 genes, significant changes in free fatty acid release were observed. However, due to off-target effects (in addition to other limitations), high-throughput RNAi-based screens in cell-based systems generate significant amounts of noise. Therefore, to obtain a more reliable set of genes from the siRNA hits in our screen, we developed and applied a novel network-based approach that elucidates the mechanisms of action for the true positive siRNA hits. Our analysis results in the identification of a core network underlying the insulin signaling pathway that is more significantly enriched for genes previously associated with insulin resistance than the set of genes annotated in the KEGG database as belonging to the insulin signaling pathway. We experimentally validated one of the predictions, S1pr2, as a novel candidate gene for T2D.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that causes a chronic debilitating polyarthralgia/polyarthritis, for which current treatments are often inadequate. To assess whether new drugs being developed for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) might find utility in the treatment of alphaviral arthritides, we sought to determine whether the inflammatory gene expression signature of CHIKV arthritis shows any similarities with RA or collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a mouse model of RA.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Using a recently developed animal model of CHIKV arthritis in adult wild-type mice, we generated a consensus CHIKV arthritis gene expression signature, which was used to interrogate publicly available microarray studies of RA and CIA. Pathway analyses were then performed using the overlapping gene signatures.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Gene set enrichment analysis showed that there was a highly significant overlap in the differentially expressed genes in the CHIKV arthritis model and in RA. This concordance also increased with the severity of RA, as measured by the inflammation score. A highly significant overlap was also seen between CHIKV arthritis and CIA. Pathway analysis revealed that the overlap between these arthritides was spread over a range of different inflammatory processes. Involvement of T cells and interferon-$\gamma$ (IFN$\gamma$) in CHIKV arthritis was confirmed in studies of MHCII-deficient mice and IFN$\gamma$-deficient mice, respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: These results suggest that RA, a chronic autoimmune arthritis, and CHIKV disease, usually a self-limiting viral arthropathy, share multiple inflammatory processes. New drugs and biologic therapies being developed for RA may thus find application in the treatment of alphaviral arthritides.},

Clone 64d, an attenuated clone of a recombinant virus (A/PR/8/34-A/England/939/69 (H3N2)) grown in organ cultures of ferret nasal turbinates, was inactivated at pyrexial temperatures more readily than a virulent Clone 7a. In addition, replication of Clone 64d was restricted at pyrexial temperatures to a greater extent than that of Clone 7a in organ cultures of both ferret nasal turbinate and lung tissue. The greater adverse effects of pyrexial temperatures on Clone 64d appears to explain the earlier reduction of upper respiratory tract infection seen in ferrets infected with this attenuated clone. Also, the differential influence of pyrexial temperatures may be the reason for the virtual lack of lung infection with Clone 64d in vivo in contrast to the consistent infection found with Clone 7a. The relevance of these findings to human infection and to markers of attenuation of influenza virus is discussed.},

abstract = {Using expression profiles from postmortem prefrontal cortex samples of 624 dementia patients and non-demented controls, we investigated global disruptions in the co-regulation of genes in two neurodegenerative diseases, late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Huntington's disease (HD). We identified networks of differentially co-expressed (DC) gene pairs that either gained or lost correlation in disease cases relative to the control group, with the former dominant for both AD and HD and both patterns replicating in independent human cohorts of AD and aging. When aligning networks of DC patterns and physical interactions, we identified a 242-gene subnetwork enriched for independent AD/HD signatures. This subnetwork revealed a surprising dichotomy of gained/lost correlations among two inter-connected processes, chromatin organization and neural differentiation, and included DNA methyltransferases, DNMT1 and DNMT3A, of which we predicted the former but not latter as a key regulator. To validate the inter-connection of these two processes and our key regulator prediction, we generated two brain-specific knockout (KO) mice and show that Dnmt1 KO signature significantly overlaps with the subnetwork (P = 3.1 × 10(-12)), while Dnmt3a KO signature does not (P = 0.017).},

abstract = {The "Spanish" influenza pandemic of 1918-19 caused acute illness in 25-30 percent of the world's population and resulted in the death of up to an estimated 40 million people. Using fixed and frozen lung tissue of 1918 influenza victims, the complete genomic sequence of the 1918 influenza virus has been deduced. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the completed 1918 influenza virus genes shows them to be the most avian-like among the mammalian-adapted viruses. This finding supports the hypotheses that (1) the pandemic virus contains genes derived from avian-like influenza virus strains and that (2) the 1918 virus is the common ancestor of human and classical swine H1N1 influenza viruses. The relationship of the 1918 virus with avian influenza viruses is further supported by recent work in which the 1918 hemagglutinin (HA) protein crystal structure was resolved. Neither the 1918 hemagglutinin (HA) nor the neuraminidase (NA) genes possess mutations known to increase tissue tropicity that account for the virulence of other influenza virus strains like A/WSN/33 or the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5 or H7 viruses. Using reverse genetics approaches, influenza virus constructs containing the 1918 HA and NA on a modern human influenza virus background were lethal in mice. The complete 1918 virus was even more virulent in mice. The genotypic basis of this virulence has not yet been elucidated. The complete sequence of the non-structural (NS) gene segment of the 1918 virus was deduced and also tested for the hypothesis that enhanced virulence in 1918 could have been due to type I interferon inhibition by the NS1 protein. Results from these experiments suggest that in human cells the 1918 NS1 is a very effective interferon antagonist, but the 1918 NS1 gene does not have the amino acid change that correlates with virulence in the H5N1 virus strains identified in 1997 in Hong Kong. Sequence analysis of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus is allowing us to test hypotheses as to the origin and virulence of this strain. This information should help elucidate how pandemic influenza virus strains emerge and what genetic features contribute to virulence in humans.},

abstract = {In this study, we investigated the role of the conserved neuraminidase (NA) cytoplasmic tail residues in influenza virus replication. Mutants of influenza A virus (A/WSN/33 [H1N1]) with deletions of the NA cytoplasmic tail region were generated by reverse genetics. The resulting viruses, designated NOTAIL, contain only the initiating methionine of the conserved six amino-terminal residues. The mutant viruses grew much less readily and produced smaller plaques than did the wild-type virus. Despite similar levels of NA cell surface expression by the NOTAIL mutants and wild-type virus, incorporation of mutant NA molecules into virions was decreased by 86{\%}. This reduction resulted in less NA activity per virion, leading to the formation of large aggregates of progeny mutant virions on the surface of infected cells. A NOTAIL virus containing an additional mutation (Ser-12 to Pro) in the transmembrane domain incorporated three times more NA molecules into virions than did the NOTAIL parent but approximately half of the amount incorporated by the wild-type virus. However, aggregation of the progeny virions still occurred at the cell surface. All NOTAIL viruses were attenuated in mice. We conclude that the cytoplasmic tail of NA is not absolutely essential for virus replication but exerts important effects on the incorporation of NA into virions and thus on the aggregation and virulence of progeny virus. In addition, the relative abundance of long filamentous particles formed by the NOTAIL mutants, compared with the largely spherical wild-type particles, indicates a role for the NA cytoplasmic tail in virion morphogenesis.},

abstract = {Currently there are relatively few antiviral therapeutics, and most which do exist are highly pathogen-specific or have other disadvantages. We have developed a new broad-spectrum antiviral approach, dubbed Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) Activated Caspase Oligomerizer (DRACO) that selectively induces apoptosis in cells containing viral dsRNA, rapidly killing infected cells without harming uninfected cells. We have created DRACOs and shown that they are nontoxic in 11 mammalian cell types and effective against 15 different viruses, including dengue flavivirus, Amapari and Tacaribe arenaviruses, Guama bunyavirus, and H1N1 influenza. We have also demonstrated that DRACOs can rescue mice challenged with H1N1 influenza. DRACOs have the potential to be effective therapeutics or prophylactics for numerous clinical and priority viruses, due to the broad-spectrum sensitivity of the dsRNA detection domain, the potent activity of the apoptosis induction domain, and the novel direct linkage between the two which viruses have never encountered.},

@article{Ramos2011,
abstract = {Humans infected by the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) present unusually high concentrations in serum of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which are believed to contribute to the high pathogenicity of these viruses. The hemagglutinins (HAs) of avian influenza viruses preferentially bind to sialic acids attached through $\alpha$2,3 linkages (SA$\alpha$2,3) to the terminal galactose of carbohydrates on the host cell surface, while the HAs from human strains bind to $\alpha$2,6-linked SA (SA$\alpha$2,6). To evaluate the role of the viral receptor specificity in promoting innate immune responses in humans, we generated recombinant influenza viruses, one bearing the HA and neuraminidase (NA) genes from the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 HPAIV in an influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (A/PR/8/34) backbone with specificity for SA$\alpha$2,3 and the other a mutant virus (with Q226L and G228S in the HA) with preferential receptor specificity for SA$\alpha$2,6. Viruses with preferential affinity for SA$\alpha$2,3 induced higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and interferon (IFN)-inducible genes in primary human dendritic cells (DCs) than viruses with SA$\alpha$2,6 binding specificity, and these differences were independent of viral replication, as shown by infections with UV-inactivated viruses. Moreover, human primary macrophages and respiratory epithelial cells showed higher expression of proinflammatory genes after infection with the virus with SA$\alpha$2,3 affinity than after infection with the virus with SA$\alpha$2,6 affinity. These data indicate that binding to SA$\alpha$2,3 by H5N1 HPAIV may be sensed by human cells differently than binding to SA$\alpha$2,6, inducing an exacerbated innate proinflammatory response in infected individuals.},

abstract = {Cultured mononuclear peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) from nonimmune human beings and monkeys are nonpermissive to dengue 2 virus (D2V) infection at multiplicities of infection of 0.001-0.1, but become permissive when non-neutralizing dengue antibody is added to medium. D2V infection occurred in PBL prepared from anti-coagulated but not from defibrinated plasma. Infection enhancement was produced by multiple lots of heterotypic anti-dengue raised in several mammalian species. Homotypic anti-dengue neutralized D2V at high concentrations but enhanced at low concentrations; enhancement end point in one serum was 1:320,000. The infection-enhancing factor was a noncytophilic antibody of the IgG class. D2V infection occurred in the absence of heat-labile complement components but did not occur when complexes were prepared with anti- dengue F(ab)(2). Treatment of PBL with several proteases increased permissiveness to D2V infection by immune complexes but not by virus alone. Two rhesus monkey serums collected 14 days after D2V infection contained an IgG antibody with high-titered enhancing activity but with no hemagglutination-inhibition or neutralizing activity. Virus-antibody complexes are irreversibly attached to PBL within 15 min and completely internalized in 60 min. There was considerable variation in cellular infection in different experiments, however, maximum virus yields usually exceeded 1,000 plaque-forming units per 1 x 10(6) PBL occurring between 2 and 4 days in culture. In vitro antibody-dependent infection of PBL provides a possible model for study of pathogenetic mechanisms in infants with dengue shock syndrome who passively acquire maternal anti-dengue IgG.},

@article{Gorry1997,
abstract = {BACKGROUND {\&} AIMS: We recently identified a single R117H mutation in the cationic trypsinogen gene in several kindreds with an inherited form of acute and chronic pancreatitis (HP1), providing strong evidence that trypsin plays a central role in premature zymogen activation and pancreatitis. However, not all families studied have this mutation. The aim of this study was to determine the disease-causing mutation in kindreds with hereditary pancreatitis that lack the previously identified mutation. METHODS: Clinical features of the HP1 kindreds were compared with those of the new kindreds (HP2), and genetic linkage analysis, screening for mutations through DNA sequencing, and screening an unaffected population were performed. RESULTS: The onset of symptoms was delayed and hospitalizations were fewer in HP2 compared with HP1 (P {\textless} 0.05). Linkage of the disease gene to chromosome 7q35 was established (logarithm of the odds, 3.73). Mutational screening identified a single A to T mutation resulting in an asparagine to isoleucine transition mutation at position 21 (N21I) in cationic trypsinogen. The mutation was absent in 94 unrelated individuals, representing 188 unique chromosomes. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of a second mutation in the cationic trypsinogen gene (HP2) suggests a dominant role of trypsin in premature protease activation-mediated forms of acute pancreatitis. The pathogenesis of hereditary pancreatitis also suggests that chronic pancreatitis may result from recurrent acute pancreatitis.},

abstract = {The wide utilization of biocides poses a concern on the impact of these compounds on natural bacterial populations. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that biocides can select, at least in laboratory experiments, antibiotic resistant bacteria. This situation has raised concerns, not just on scientists and clinicians, but also on regulatory agencies, which are demanding studies on the impact that the utilization of biocides may have on the development on resistance and consequently on the treatment of infectious diseases and on human health. In the present article, we explored the possibility that the widely used biocide triclosan might induce antibiotic resistance using as a model the opportunistic pathogen Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Biochemical, functional and structural studies were performed, focusing on SmeDEF, the most relevant antibiotic- and triclosan-removing multidrug efflux pump of S. maltophilia. Expression of smeDEF is regulated by the repressor SmeT. Triclosan released SmeT from its operator and induces the expression of smeDEF, thus reducing the susceptibility of S. maltophilia to antibiotics in the presence of the biocide. The structure of SmeT bound to triclosan is described. Two molecules of triclosan were found to bind to one subunit of the SmeT homodimer. The binding of the biocide stabilizes the N terminal domain of both subunits in a conformation unable to bind DNA. To our knowledge this is the first crystal structure obtained for a transcriptional regulator bound to triclosan. This work provides the molecular basis for understanding the mechanisms allowing the induction of phenotypic resistance to antibiotics by triclosan.},

In addition to previously described SMRT sequencing of N6-methyladenine and 5-methylcytosine, we show that N4-methylcytosine also has a specific kinetic signature and is therefore identifiable using this approach. We demonstrate for all three prokaryotic methylation types that SMRT sequencing confirms the identity and position of the methylated base in cases where the MTase specificity was previously established by other methods. We then applied the method to determine the sequence context and methylated base identity for three MTases with unknown specificities. In addition, we also find evidence of unanticipated MTase promiscuity with some enzymes apparently also modifying sequences that are related, but not identical, to the cognate site.},

Networks based on different types of data are compared using metrics devised to assess the predictive power of a network. We show that a network reconstructed by integrating genotypic, TFBS and PPI data is the most predictive. This network is used to predict causal regulators responsible for hot spots of gene expression activity in a segregating yeast population. We also show that the network can elucidate the mechanisms by which causal regulators give rise to larger-scale changes in gene expression activity. We then prospectively validate predictions, providing direct experimental evidence that predictive networks can be constructed by integrating multiple, appropriate data types.},

Visits from January 1, 2000, to September 30, 2004, were segmented into age group subpopulations. Timeliness and prediction of each subpopulation were measured against pneumonia and influenza mortality in New England with time-series analyses and regression models. Study results show that patient age significantly influences timeliness (p = 0.026), with pediatric age groups arriving first (p {\textless} 0.001); children aged 3-4 years are consistently the earliest (p = 0.0058). Age also influences the degree of prediction of mortality (p = 0.036), with illness among children under age 5 years, compared with all other patients, most strongly associated with mortality (p {\textless} 0.001).

Genes associated with similar disorders show both higher likelihood of physical interactions between their products and higher expression profiling similarity for their transcripts, supporting the existence of distinct disease-specific functional modules. We find that essential human genes are likely to encode hub proteins and are expressed widely in most tissues. This suggests that disease genes also would play a central role in the human interactome. In contrast, we find that the vast majority of disease genes are nonessential and show no tendency to encode hub proteins, and their expression pattern indicates that they are localized in the functional periphery of the network. A selection-based model explains the observed difference between essential and disease genes and also suggests that diseases caused by somatic mutations should not be peripheral, a prediction we confirm for cancer genes.},

abstract = {The organization and function of the Bacillus subtilis YsiA regulon involved in fatty acid degradation were investigated. Northern and primer extension analyses indicated that this regulon comprises five operons, i.e. lcfA-ysiA-B-etfB-A, ykuF-G, yhfL, yusM-L-K-J, and ywjF-acdA-rpoE. YusJ and AcdA, YsiB and YusL, and YusK presumably encode acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, 3-hydroxyl-CoA dehydrogenase/enoyl-CoA hydratase complexes, and acetyl-CoA C-acyltransferase, respectively, which are directly involved in the fatty acid beta-oxidation cycle. In addition, LcfA and YhfL are likely to encode long chain acyl-CoA ligases. On gel retardation and footprinting analyses involving the purified YsiA protein, we identified cis-sequences for YsiA binding (YsiA boxes) in the promoter regions upstream of ysiA, ykuF, yusL, yhfL, and ywjF, the equilibrium dissociation constants (K(d)) for YsiA binding being 20, 21, 37, 43, and 65 nm, respectively. YsiA binding was specifically inhibited by long chain acyl-CoAs with 14-20 carbon atoms, acyl-CoAs with 18 carbon atoms being more effective; out of long chain acyl-CoAs tested, monounsaturated oleoyl-CoA, and branched chain 12-metyltetradecanoyl-CoA were most effective. These in vitro findings were supported by the in vivo observation that the knock-out of acyl-CoA dehydrogenation through yusJ, etfA, or etfB disruption resulted in YsiA inactivation, probably because of the accumulation of long chain acyl-CoAs in the cells. Furthermore, the disruption of yusL, yusK, yusJ, etfA, etfB, or ykuG affected the utilization of palmitic acid, a representative long chain fatty acid. Based on this work, ysiA, ysiB, ykuF, ykuG, yhfL, yusM, yusL, yusK, yusJ, and ywjF can be renamed fadR, fadB, fadH, fadG, lcfB, fadM, fadN, fadA, fadE, and fadF.},

abstract = {Nucleic acid amplification of clinical specimens with low target concentration has variable sensitivity. We examined whether testing multiple aliquots of extracted DNA increased the sensitivity and reproducibility of Chlamydia pneumoniae detection by PCR. Nested and non-nested C. pneumoniae PCR assays were compared using 10 replicates of 16 serial dilutions of C. pneumoniae ATCC VR-1310. The proportion positive versus the C. pneumoniae concentration was modeled by probit regression analysis. To validate the model, 10 replicates of 26 previously positive patient specimens of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), sputum, or nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) were tested. The proportion of replicates that were positive varied with the concentration of C. pneumoniae in the sample. At concentrations above 5 infection-forming units (IFU)/ml, both nested and non-nested PCR assay sensitivities were 90{\%} or greater. The nested PCR was more sensitive (median detection, 0.35 versus 0.61 IFU/ml; relative median detection, 0.58; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.31 to 0.99; P = 0.04). In clinical specimens, replicate PCR detected 15 of 26 (nested) versus 1 of 26 (non-nested, P {\textless} 0.001). For PBMC specimens, testing 1, 3, or 5 replicates detected 3, 5, or 9 of 10 positive specimens, respectively. Median C. pneumoniae concentrations were estimated at 0.07 IFU/ml for PBMC and at {\textless}0.03 IFU/ml for NPS specimens. We conclude that performing 5 or 10 replicates considerably increased the sensitivity and reproducibility of C. pneumoniae PCR and enabled quantitation for clinical specimens. Due to sampling variability, PCR tests done without replication may miss a large proportion of positive specimens, particularly for specimens with small amounts of target C. pneumoniae DNA present.},

abstract = {The H9N2 subtype influenza virus (IV) is a remarkable member of the influenza A viruses because it can infect not only chickens, ducks and pigs, but also humans. Pigs are susceptible to both human and avian influenza viruses and have been proposed to be intermediate hosts for the generation of pandemic influenza viruses through reassortment or adaptation to the mammalian host. To further understand the genetic characteristics and evolution, we investigated the source and molecular characteristics of the H9N2 subtype swine influenza virus (SIV), and observed its pathogenicity in BALB/c mice. The BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with 100 median mouse infectious dose of A/swine/HeBei/012/2008/(H9N2) viruses to observe the pathogenicity. The HA, NP, NA and M gene were cloned, sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed with related sequences available in GenBank. The infected mice presented with inactivity, weight loss and laboured respiration, while the pathological changes were characterized by diffuse alveolar damage in the lung. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of HA, NP, NA and M gene was similar with that of A/chicken/Hebei/4/2008(H9N2). The HA protein contained 6 glycosylation sites and the motif of HA cleavage site was PARSSR GLF, which is characteristic of low pathogenic IV. In the HA, NP, M and NA gene phylogenetic trees, the isolate clustered with A/chicken/Hebei/4/2008(H9N2). The isolate possibly came from A/chicken/Hebei/4/2008(H9N2) and was partially varied during its cross-species spread.},

The differential expression of CD14 and CD16 distinguishes classical CD14(++)CD16(-), intermediate CD14(++)CD16(+), and nonclassical CD14(+)CD16(++) monocytes. Current knowledge on human monocyte heterogeneity is still incomplete: while it is increasingly acknowledged that CD14(++)CD16(+) monocytes are of outstanding significance in 2 global health issues, namely HIV-1 infection and atherosclerosis, CD14(++)CD16(+) monocytes remain the most poorly characterized subset so far. We therefore developed a method to purify the 3 monocyte subsets from human blood and analyzed their transcriptomes using SuperSAGE in combination with high-throughput sequencing. Analysis of 5 487 603 tags revealed unique identifiers of CD14(++)CD16(+) monocytes, delineating these cells from the 2 other monocyte subsets. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis suggests diverse immunologic functions, linking CD14(++)CD16(+) monocytes to Ag processing and presentation (eg, CD74, HLA-DR, IFI30, CTSB), to inflammation and monocyte activation (eg, TGFB1, AIF1, PTPN6), and to angiogenesis (eg, TIE2, CD105). In conclusion, we provide genetic evidence for a distinct role of CD14(++)CD16(+) monocytes in human immunity. After CD14(++)CD16(+) monocytes have earlier been discussed as a potential therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases, we are hopeful that our data will spur further research in the field of monocyte heterogeneity.},

abstract = {The severity of epidemic and pandemic influenza outbreaks is dictated in part by the efficiency with which the causative strain transmits between human hosts. The mechanisms underlying influenza virus spread are poorly understood, in part because of the lack of a convenient animal model to study this phenomenon. Indeed, despite extremely efficient transmission among humans and virulence in the mouse model, we have shown that even the 1918 pandemic influenza virus does not transmit between mice. We therefore evaluated the guinea pig as a model mammalian host for influenza virus. Using the recent human isolate A/Panama/2007/99 (Pan/99) (H3N2) virus, we found that guinea pigs were highly susceptible to infection with the unadapted virus (ID(50) = 5 plaque-forming units). Pan/99 virus grew to high titers in the upper respiratory tract and was shed in nasal washings of infected animals. Moreover, influenza virus was transmitted from infected guinea pigs to noninfected guinea pigs housed in the same cage, an adjacent cage, and a cage placed 91 cm away. Our results demonstrate that influenza virus can pass between guinea pigs by means of droplet spread and thereby establish the suitability of the guinea pig as a model host for influenza virus transmission studies.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: Prevention of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a substantial therapeutic challenge. A previous prospective study of 63 patients with CDI identified risk factors associated with recurrence. This study aimed to develop a prediction rule for recurrent CDI using the above derivation cohort and prospectively evaluate the performance of this rule in an independent validation cohort. Methods: The clinical prediction rule was developed by multivariate logistic regression analysis and included the following variables: age {\textgreater}65 years, severe or fulminant illness (by the Horn index), and additional antibiotic use after CDI therapy. A second rule combined data on serum concentrations of immunoglobulin G (IgG) against toxin A with the clinical predictors. Both rules were then evaluated prospectively in an independent cohort of 89 patients with CDI. Results: The clinical prediction rule discriminated between patients with and without recurrent CDI, with an area under the curve of the receiver-operating-characteristic curve of 0.83 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 0.70-0.95) in the derivation cohort and 0.80 (95{\%} CI: 0.67-0.92) in the validation cohort. The rule correctly classified 77.3{\%} (95{\%} CI: 62.2{\%}-88.5{\%}) and 71.9{\%} (95{\%} CI: 59.2{\%}-82.4{\%}) of patients in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. The combined rule performed well in the derivation cohort but not in the validation cohort (area under the curve of the receiver-operating-characteristic curve, 0.89 vs 0.62; diagnostic accuracy, 93.8{\%} vs 69.2{\%}, respectively). Conclusions: We prospectively derived and validated a clinical prediction rule for recurrent CDI that is simple, reliable, and accurate and can be used to identify high-risk patients most likely to benefit from measures to prevent recurrence. {\textcopyright} 2009 AGA Institute.},

abstract = {New official nomenclature subdivides human monocytes into 3 subsets: the classical (CD14(++)CD16(-)), intermediate (CD14(++)CD16(+)), and nonclassical (CD14(+)CD16(++)) monocytes. This introduces new challenges, as monocyte heterogeneity is mostly understood based on 2 subsets, the CD16(-) and CD16(+) monocytes. Here, we comprehensively defined the 3 circulating human monocyte subsets using microarray, flow cytometry, and cytokine production analysis. We find that intermediate monocytes expressed a large majority (87{\%}) of genes and surface proteins at levels between classical and nonclassical monocytes. This establishes their intermediary nature at the molecular level. We unveil the close relationship between the intermediate and nonclassic monocytes, along with features that separate them. Intermediate monocytes expressed highest levels of major histocompatibility complex class II, GFR$\alpha$2 and CLEC10A, whereas nonclassic monocytes were distinguished by cytoskeleton rearrangement genes, inflammatory cytokine production, and CD294 and Siglec10 surface expression. In addition, we identify new features for classic monocytes, including AP-1 transcription factor genes, CLEC4D and IL-13R$\alpha$1 surface expression. We also find circumstantial evidence supporting the developmental relationship between the 3 subsets, including gradual changes in maturation genes and surface markers. By comprehensively defining the 3 monocyte subsets during healthy conditions, we facilitate target identification and detailed analyses of aberrations that may occur to monocyte subsets during diseases.},

abstract = {Many human diseases are caused by pathogens that produce exotoxins. The genes that encode these exotoxins are frequently encoded by mobile DNA elements such as plasmids or phage. Mobile DNA elements can move exotoxin genes among microbial hosts, converting avirulent bacteria into pathogens. Phage and bacteria from water, soil, and sediment environments represent a potential reservoir of phage- and plasmid-encoded exotoxin genes. The genes encoding exotoxins that are the causes of cholera, diphtheria, enterohemorrhagic diarrhea, and Staphylococcus aureus food poisoning were found in soil, sediment, and water samples by standard PCR assays from locations where the human diseases are uncommon or nonexistent. On average, at least one of the target exotoxin genes was detected in approximately 15{\%} of the more than 300 environmental samples tested. The results of standard PCR assays were confirmed by quantitative PCR (QPCR) and Southern dot blot analyses. Agreement between the results of the standard PCR and QPCR ranged from 63{\%} to 84{\%}; and the agreement between standard PCR and Southern dot blots ranged from 50{\%} to 66{\%}. Both the cholera and shiga exotoxin genes were also found in the free phage DNA fraction. The results indicate that phage-encoded exotoxin genes are widespread and mobile in terrestrial and aquatic environments.},

@book{Care2014,
abstract = {Health care in America presents a fundamental paradox. The past 50 years have seen an explosion in biomedical knowledge, dramatic innovation in therapies and surgical procedures, and management of conditions that previously were fatal, with ever more exciting clinical capabilities on the horizon. Yet, American health care is falling short on basic dimensions of quality, outcomes, costs, and equity. Available knowledge is too rarely applied to improve the care experience, and information generated by the care experience is too rarely gathered to improve the knowledge available. The traditional systems for transmitting new knowledge—the ways clinicians are educated, deployed, rewarded, and updated—can no longer keep pace with scientific advances. If unaddressed, the current shortfalls in the performance of the nation's health care system will deepen on both quality and cost dimensions, challenging the well-being of Americans now and potentially far into the future. Health care needs major improvements with respect to its ability to meet patients' specific needs, to offer choice, to adapt, to become more affordable, to improve—in short, to learn. Americans should be served by a health care system that consistently delivers reliable performance and constantly improves, systematically and seamlessly, with each care experience and transition. In the face of these realities, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) convened the Committee on the Learning Health Care System in America to explore the most fundamental challenges to health care today and to propose actions that can be taken to achieve a health care system characterized by continuous learning and improvement. This report, Best Care at Lower Cost: The Path to Continuously Learning Health Care in America, explores the imperatives for change, the emerging tools that make transformation possible, the vision for a continuously learning health care system, and the path for achieving this vision. The title of the report underscores that care that is based on the best available evidence, takes appropriate account of individual preferences, and is delivered reliably and efficiently—best care—is possible today, and also is generally less expensive than the less effective, less efficient care that is now too commonly provided. The foundation for a learning health care system is continuous knowledge development, improvement, and application. Although unprecedented levels of information are available, patients and clinicians often lack access to guidance that is relevant, timely, and useful for the circumstances at hand. Overcoming this challenge will require applying computing capabilities and analytic approaches to develop real-time insights from routine patient care, disseminating knowledge using new technological tools, and addressing the regulatory challenges that can inhibit progress. Engaged patients are central to an effective, efficient, and continuously learning system. Clinicians supply information and advice based on their scientific expertise in treatment and intervention options, along with potential outcomes, while patients, their families, and other caregivers bring personal knowledge on the suitability—or lack thereof—of different treatments for the patient's circumstances and preferences. Both perspectives are needed to select the right care option for the patient. Communication and collaboration among patients, their families, and care teams are needed to fully address the issues affecting patients. Health care payment policies strongly influence how care is delivered, whether new scientific insights and knowledge about best care are diffused broadly, and whether improvement initiatives succeed. New models of paying for care and organizing care delivery are emerging to improve quality and value. While evidence is conflicting on which payment models might work best and under what circumstances, it is clear that high-value care requires structuring incentives to reward the best outcomes for patients. Finally, the culture of health care is central to promoting learning at every level. Creating continuously learning organizations that generate and transfer knowledge from every patient interaction will require systematic problem solving; the application of systems engineering techniques; operational models that encourage and reward sustained quality and improved patient outcomes; transparency on cost and outcomes; and strong leadership and governance that define, disseminate, and support a vision of continuous improvement. Achieving the vision of continuously learning health care will depend on broad action by the complex network of individuals and organizations that make up the current health care system. Missed opportunities for better health care have real human and economic impacts. If the care in every state were of the quality delivered by the highest-performing state, an estimated 75,000 fewer deaths would have occurred across the country in 2005. Current waste diverts resources from productive use, resulting in an estimated {\$}750 billion loss in 2009. It is only through shared commitments, with a supportive policy environment, that the opportunities afforded by science and information technology can be captured to address the health care system's growing challenges and to ensure that the system reaches its full potential. The nation's health and economic futures—best care at lower cost—depend on the ability to steward the evolution of a continuously learning health care system.},

abstract = {The inference of transcriptional networks that regulate transitions into physiological or pathological cellular states remains a central challenge in systems biology. A mesenchymal phenotype is the hallmark of tumour aggressiveness in human malignant glioma, but the regulatory programs responsible for implementing the associated molecular signature are largely unknown. Here we show that reverse-engineering and an unbiased interrogation of a glioma-specific regulatory network reveal the transcriptional module that activates expression of mesenchymal genes in malignant glioma. Two transcription factors (C/EBPbeta and STAT3) emerge as synergistic initiators and master regulators of mesenchymal transformation. Ectopic co-expression of C/EBPbeta and STAT3 reprograms neural stem cells along the aberrant mesenchymal lineage, whereas elimination of the two factors in glioma cells leads to collapse of the mesenchymal signature and reduces tumour aggressiveness. In human glioma, expression of C/EBPbeta and STAT3 correlates with mesenchymal differentiation and predicts poor clinical outcome. These results show that the activation of a small regulatory module is necessary and sufficient to initiate and maintain an aberrant phenotypic state in cancer cells.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Arthritogenic alphaviruses, including Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), are responsible for acute fever and arthralgia, but can also lead to chronic symptoms. In 2006, a Chikungunya outbreak occurred in La R{\'{e}}union Island, during which we constituted a prospective cohort of viremic patients (n = 180) and defined the clinical and biological features of acute infection. Individuals were followed as part of a longitudinal study to investigate in details the long-term outcome of Chikungunya.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Patients were submitted to clinical investigations 4, 6, 14 and 36 months after presentation with acute CHIKV infection. At 36 months, 22 patients with arthralgia and 20 patients without arthralgia were randomly selected from the cohort and consented for blood sampling. During the 3 years following acute infection, 60{\%} of patients had experienced symptoms of arthralgia, with most reporting episodic relapse and recovery periods. Long-term arthralgias were typically polyarthralgia (70{\%}), that were usually symmetrical (90{\%}) and highly incapacitating (77{\%}). They were often associated with local swelling (63{\%}), asthenia (77{\%}) or depression (56{\%}). The age over 35 years and the presence of arthralgia 4 months after the disease onset are risk factors of long-term arthralgia. Patients with long-term arthralgia did not display biological markers typically found in autoimmune or rheumatoid diseases. These data helped define the features of CHIKV-associated chronic arthralgia and permitted an estimation of the economic burden associated with arthralgia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that chronic arthralgia is a frequent complication of acute Chikungunya disease and suggests that it results from a local rather than systemic inflammation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Infection with dengue viruses (DENV) leads to a spectrum of disease outcomes. The pathophysiology of severe versus non-severe manifestations of DENV infection may be driven by host responses, which could be reflected in the transcriptional profiles of peripheral blood immune cells.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted genome-wide microarray analysis of whole blood RNA from 34 DENV-infected children in Nicaragua collected on days 3-6 of illness, with different disease manifestations. Gene expression analysis identified genes that are differentially regulated between clinical subgroups. The most striking transcriptional differences were observed between dengue patients with and without shock, especially in the expression of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins associated with protein biosynthesis. In the dengue hemorrhagic fever patients, one subset of differentially expressed genes encode neutrophil-derived anti-microbial peptides associated with innate immunity. By performing a meta-analysis of our dataset in conjunction with previously published datasets, we confirmed that DENV infection in vivo is associated with large changes to protein and nucleic acid metabolism. Additionally, whereas in vitro infection leads to an increased interferon signature, this was not consistently observed from in vivo patient samples, suggesting that the interferon response in vivo is relatively transient and was no longer observed by days 3-6 of illness.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data highlight important differences between different manifestations of severity during DENV infection as well as identify some commonalities. Compilation of larger datasets in the future across multiple studies, as we have initiated in this report, may well lead to better prediction of disease manifestation via a systems biology approach.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Sample mix-ups can arise during sample collection, handling, genotyping or data management. It is unclear how often sample mix-ups occur in genome-wide studies, as there currently are no post hoc methods that can identify these mix-ups in unrelated samples. We have therefore developed an algorithm (MixupMapper) that can both detect and correct sample mix-ups in genome-wide studies that study gene expression levels.

RESULTS: We applied MixupMapper to five publicly available human genetical genomics datasets. On average, 3{\%} of all analyzed samples had been assigned incorrect expression phenotypes: in one of the datasets 23{\%} of the samples had incorrect expression phenotypes. The consequences of sample mix-ups are substantial: when we corrected these sample mix-ups, we identified on average 15{\%} more significant cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs). In one dataset, we identified three times as many significant cis-eQTLs after correction. Furthermore, we show through simulations that sample mix-ups can lead to an underestimation of the explained heritability of complex traits in genome-wide association datasets.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To characterize at the genomic level the evolution of multiresistance during an outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae in a burns intensive care unit. The outbreak involved a DHA-1 $\beta$-lactamase-producing strain that later acquired carbapenem and fosfomycin resistance, and in one case colistin resistance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The genomes of two isolates were sequenced and compared with a previously sequenced genome. The role of hypermutability was investigated by measuring the mutation frequencies of the isolates and comparison with a collection of control strains.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Sequence comparison identified four single-nucleotide variants and two transposon insertions. Analysis of the variants in the whole collection related carbapenem and fosfomycin resistance to a nonsense mutation in the ompK36 porin gene and colistin resistance to an IS1 insertion in the mgrB gene. The plasmid carrying the blaDHA-1 gene was unstable in the absence of antibiotics, and analysis of isolates that had lost the plasmid showed that the porin mutation alone was not sufficient to generate carbapenem resistance. The mutation frequencies were similar among all the strains analysed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Carbapenem resistance required production of the DHA-1 $\beta$-lactamase and decreased permeability, but fosfomycin resistance depended only on permeability. Resistance to colistin might be related to an alteration in the regulation of the phoPQ system. Hypermutation is not related to the selection of porin mutants. Plasmid instability might be due to the high number of mobile elements and suggests a major role for antibiotic selection pressure in the emergence and evolution of this outbreak.},

The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) Query Health initiative is a collaboration to develop a national architecture for distributed, population-level health queries across diverse clinical systems with disparate data models. Here we review Query Health activities, including a standards-based methodology, an open-source reference implementation, and three pilot projects.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Query Health defined a standards-based approach for distributed population health queries, using an ontology based on the Quality Data Model and Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture, Health Quality Measures Format (HQMF) as the query language, the Query Envelope as the secure transport layer, and the Quality Reporting Document Architecture as the result language.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We implemented this approach using Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) and hQuery for data analytics and PopMedNet for access control, secure query distribution, and response. We deployed the reference implementation at three pilot sites: two public health departments (New York City and Massachusetts) and one pilot designed to support Food and Drug Administration post-market safety surveillance activities. The pilots were successful, although improved cross-platform data normalization is needed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSIONS: This initiative resulted in a standards-based methodology for population health queries, a reference implementation, and revision of the HQMF standard. It also informed future directions regarding interoperability and data access for ONC's Data Access Framework initiative.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Query Health was a test of the learning health system that supplied a functional methodology and reference implementation for distributed population health queries that has been validated at three sites.},

abstract = {Human cancer cells typically harbour multiple chromosomal aberrations, nucleotide substitutions and epigenetic modifications that drive malignant transformation. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pilot project aims to assess the value of large-scale multi-dimensional analysis of these molecular characteristics in human cancer and to provide the data rapidly to the research community. Here we report the interim integrative analysis of DNA copy number, gene expression and DNA methylation aberrations in 206 glioblastomas--the most common type of adult brain cancer--and nucleotide sequence aberrations in 91 of the 206 glioblastomas. This analysis provides new insights into the roles of ERBB2, NF1 and TP53, uncovers frequent mutations of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase regulatory subunit gene PIK3R1, and provides a network view of the pathways altered in the development of glioblastoma. Furthermore, integration of mutation, DNA methylation and clinical treatment data reveals a link between MGMT promoter methylation and a hypermutator phenotype consequent to mismatch repair deficiency in treated glioblastomas, an observation with potential clinical implications. Together, these findings establish the feasibility and power of TCGA, demonstrating that it can rapidly expand knowledge of the molecular basis of cancer.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop and implement a clinical decision support (CDS) tool to improve antibiotic prescribing in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and to evaluate user acceptance of the CDS tool.

METHODS: Following sociotechnical analysis of NICU prescribing processes, a CDS tool for empiric and targeted antimicrobial therapy for healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) was developed and incorporated into a commercial electronic health record (EHR) in two NICUs. User logs were reviewed and NICU prescribers were surveyed for their perceptions of the CDS tool.

RESULTS: The CDS tool aggregated selected laboratory results, including culture results, to make treatment recommendations for common clinical scenarios. From July 2010 to May 2012, 1,303 CDS activations for 452 patients occurred representing 22{\%} of patients prescribed antibiotics during this period. While NICU clinicians viewed two culture results per tool activation, prescribing recommendations were viewed during only 15{\%} of activations. Most (63{\%}) survey respondents were aware of the CDS tool, but fewer (37{\%}) used it during their most recent NICU rotation. Respondents considered the most useful features to be summarized culture results (43{\%}) and antibiotic recommendations (48{\%}).

DISCUSSION: During the study period, the CDS tool functionality was hindered by EHR upgrades, implementation of a new laboratory information system, and changes to antimicrobial testing methodologies. Loss of functionality may have reduced viewing antibiotic recommendations. In contrast, viewing culture results was frequently performed, likely because this feature was perceived as useful and functionality was preserved.

CONCLUSION: To improve CDS tool visibility and usefulness, we recommend early user and information technology team involvement which would facilitate use and mitigate implementation challenges.},

Both patients presented with low grade fever, malaise, conjunctivitis, myalgia, arthralgia, ankle oedema, and axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy. One patient showed leukopenia with relative monocytosis and thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis was based on ZIKV seroconversion in both cases and on ZIKV RNA detection in one patient from acute serum sample. Sera from both patients exhibited cross-reactivity with dengue virus antigens. Our immunological analysis demonstrated that recovery from ZIKV infection is associated with restoration of normal numbers of immune cells in the periphery as well as with normal function of antigen-presenting cells. ZIKV is an emerging arbovirus, which has recently spread extensively in tourist destinations on several West Pacific islands. Returning viremic travelers may ignite autochthonous infections in countries like Italy, which are infested by Aedes albopictus, a suitable vector for ZIKV. The role of clinicians is crucial and includes early diagnosis and timely notification of public health authorities in order to quickly implement adequate focal vector control measurements.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) is used extensively to characterize the transcriptome of cells. Many transcriptomic studies aim at comparing either abundance levels or the transcriptome composition between given conditions, and as a first step, the sequencing reads must be used as the basis for abundance quantification of transcriptomic features of interest, such as genes or transcripts. Various quantification approaches have been proposed, ranging from simple counting of reads that overlap given genomic regions to more complex estimation of underlying transcript abundances. In this paper, we show that gene-level abundance estimates and statistical inference offer advantages over transcript-level analyses, in terms of performance and interpretability. We also illustrate that the presence of differential isoform usage can lead to inflated false discovery rates in differential gene expression analyses on simple count matrices but that this can be addressed by incorporating offsets derived from transcript-level abundance estimates. We also show that the problem is relatively minor in several real data sets. Finally, we provide an R package ( tximport) to help users integrate transcript-level abundance estimates from common quantification pipelines into count-based statistical inference engines.},

RESULTS: I present some of the most notable new features and extensions of RAxML, such as a substantial extension of substitution models and supported data types, the introduction of SSE3, AVX and AVX2 vector intrinsics, techniques for reducing the memory requirements of the code and a plethora of operations for conducting post-analyses on sets of trees. In addition, an up-to-date 50-page user manual covering all new RAxML options is available.},

abstract = {Common human diseases result from the interplay of many genes and environmental factors. Therefore, a more integrative biology approach is needed to unravel the complexity and causes of such diseases. To elucidate the complexity of common human diseases such as obesity, we have analysed the expression of 23,720 transcripts in large population-based blood and adipose tissue cohorts comprehensively assessed for various phenotypes, including traits related to clinical obesity. In contrast to the blood expression profiles, we observed a marked correlation between gene expression in adipose tissue and obesity-related traits. Genome-wide linkage and association mapping revealed a highly significant genetic component to gene expression traits, including a strong genetic effect of proximal (cis) signals, with 50{\%} of the cis signals overlapping between the two tissues profiled. Here we demonstrate an extensive transcriptional network constructed from the human adipose data that exhibits significant overlap with similar network modules constructed from mouse adipose data. A core network module in humans and mice was identified that is enriched for genes involved in the inflammatory and immune response and has been found to be causally associated to obesity-related traits.},

Variables in the risk prediction model were age, CDI pressure, times admitted to hospital in the previous 60 days, modified Acute Physiology Score, days of treatment with high-risk antibiotics, whether albumin level was low, admission to an intensive care unit, and receipt of laxatives, gastric acid suppressors, or antimotility drugs. The calibration and discrimination of the model were very good to excellent (C index, 0.88; Brier score, 0.009).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The CDI risk prediction model performed well. Further study is needed to determine whether it could be used in a clinical setting to prevent CDI-associated outcomes and reduce costs.},

abstract = {Background: Clostridium difficile infection remains a major challenge for hospitals. Although targeted infection control initiatives have been shown to be effective in reducing the incidence of hospital-acquired C.difficile infection, there is little evidence available to assess the effectiveness of specific interventions. Aim: To use statistical modelling to detect substantial reductions in the incidence of C.difficile from time series data from two hospitals in England, and relate these time points to infection control interventions. Methods: A statistical breakpoints model was fitted to likely hospital-acquired C.difficile infection incidence data from a teaching hospital (2002-2009) and a district general hospital (2005-2009) in England. Models with increasing complexity (i.e. increasing the number of breakpoints) were tested for an improved fit to the data. Partitions estimated from breakpoint models were tested for individual stability using statistical process control charts. Major infection control interventions from both hospitals during this time were grouped according to their primary target (antibiotics, cleaning, isolation, other) and mapped to the model-suggested breakpoints. Findings: For both hospitals, breakpoints coincided with enhancements to cleaning protocols. Statistical models enabled formal assessment of the impact of different interventions, and showed that enhancements to deep cleaning programmes are the interventions that have most likely led to substantial reductions in hospital-acquired C.difficile infections at the two hospitals studied. ?? 2013 The Healthcare Infection Society.},

Several studies investigating this issue with regard to intensive care unit (ICU) patients have probably overestimated, as a result of inappropriate study methods, the part played by NIs in prolonging the length of stay.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Data from a prospective study of the incidence of NI in 5 ICUs over a period of 18 months formed the basis of this analysis. For describing the temporal dynamics of the data, a multistate model was used. Thus, ICU patients were counted as case patients as soon as an NI was ascertained on any particular day. All patients were then regarded as control subjects as long as they remained free of NI (time-to-event data analysis technique).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Admitted patients (n=1,876) were observed for the development of NI over a period of 28,498 patient-days. In total, 431 NIs were ascertained during the study period (incidence density, 15.1 NIs per 1,000 patient-days). The influence of NI as a time-dependent covariate in a proportional hazards model was highly significant (P{\textless} .0001, Wald test). NI significantly reduced the discharge hazard (hazard ratio, 0.72 [95{\%} confidence interval, 0.63-0.82])--that is, it prolonged the ICU stay. The mean prolongation of ICU length of stay due to NI (+/- standard error) was estimated to be 5.3+/-1.6 days.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Further studies are required to enable comparison of data on prolongation of ICU length of stay with the results of various study methods.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The short reads output by first- and second-generation DNA sequencing instruments cannot completely reconstruct microbial chromosomes. Therefore, most genomes have been left unfinished due to the significant resources required to manually close gaps in draft assemblies. Third-generation, single-molecule sequencing addresses this problem by greatly increasing sequencing read length, which simplifies the assembly problem.

RESULTS: To measure the benefit of single-molecule sequencing on microbial genome assembly, we sequenced and assembled the genomes of six bacteria and analyzed the repeat complexity of 2,267 complete bacteria and archaea. Our results indicate that the majority of known bacterial and archaeal genomes can be assembled without gaps, at finished-grade quality, using a single PacBio RS sequencing library. These single-library assemblies are also more accurate than typical short-read assemblies and hybrid assemblies of short and long reads.

CONCLUSIONS: Automated assembly of long, single-molecule sequencing data reduces the cost of microbial finishing to {\$}1,000 for most genomes, and future advances in this technology are expected to drive the cost lower. This is expected to increase the number of completed genomes, improve the quality of microbial genome databases, and enable high-fidelity, population-scale studies of pan-genomes and chromosomal organization.},

In this study, we performed a genome-wide association study in 18,722 unrelated individuals of European ancestry from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consortium and the Blue Mountain Eye Study, to identify genetic determinants associated with variations in retinal arteriolar caliber. Retinal vascular calibers were measured on digitized retinal photographs using a standardized protocol. One variant (rs2194025 on chromosome 5q14 near the myocyte enhancer factor 2C MEF2C gene) was associated with retinal arteriolar caliber in the meta-analysis of the discovery cohorts at genome-wide significance of P-value {\textless}5×10(-8). This variant was replicated in an additional 3,939 individuals of European ancestry from the Australian Twins Study and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (rs2194025, P-value = 2.11×10(-12) in combined meta-analysis of discovery and replication cohorts). In independent studies of modest sample sizes, no significant association was found between this variant and clinical outcomes including coronary artery disease, stroke, myocardial infarction or hypertension. In conclusion, we found one novel loci which underlie genetic variation in microvasculature which may be relevant to vascular disease. The relevance of these findings to clinical outcomes remains to be determined.},

abstract = {Common human diseases like obesity and diabetes are driven by complex networks of genes and any number of environmental factors. To understand this complexity in hopes of identifying targets and developing drugs against disease, a systematic approach is required to elucidate the genetic and environmental factors and interactions among and between these factors, and to establish how these factors induce changes in gene networks that in turn lead to disease. The explosion of large-scale, high-throughput technologies in the biological sciences has enabled researchers to take a more systems biology approach to study complex traits like disease. Genotyping of hundreds of thousands of DNA markers and profiling tens of thousands of molecular phenotypes simultaneously in thousands of individuals is now possible, and this scale of data is making it possible for the first time to reconstruct whole gene networks associated with disease. In the following sections, we review different approaches for integrating genetic expression and clinical data to infer causal relationships among gene expression traits and between expression and disease traits. We further review methods to integrate these data in a more comprehensive manner to identify common pathways shared by the causal factors driving disease, including the reconstruction of association and probabilistic causal networks. Particular attention is paid to integrating diverse information to refine these types of networks so that they are more predictive. To highlight these different approaches in practice, we step through an example on how Insig2 was identified as a causal factor for plasma cholesterol levels in mice.},

Here, we used a multiplex PCR on genomic DNA to quantify the combinatorial diversity of all possible V-J rearrangements at the TCR-beta chain and heavy chain Ig locus. We first show that the combinatorial diversity of the TCR-beta chain generated in the thymus was well preserved in the periphery, suggesting that human T cells were not vastly activated in mice, in agreement with phenotypic studies. We then show that the combinatorial diversity in NOD.SCID.gammac(-/-) mice reached 100{\%} of human reference samples for both the TCR and the heavy chain of Ig. To document the functionality of this repertoire, we show that a detectable but weak HLA-restricted cellular immune response could be elicited in reconstituted mice after immunization with an adenoviral vector expressing HCV envelope glycoproteins. Altogether, our results suggest that humanized mice express a diversified repertoire and are able to mount antigen-specific immune responses.},

A fairly recent offering of the best online mapping systems is aerial imagery. Such imagery takes the so-called GeoWeb to the next level, providing tremendous value to activities such as real estate sales, insurance, environmental management, municipal government, emergency services, and law enforcement, as well as engaging serendipitous Web users. Yet the imagery often is not detailed enough, and viewing buildings and streets from above can be disconcerting. To address this limitation, Google launched the Street View feature of Google Maps in May 2007.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Reports of clinical trials usually emphasize efficacy results, especially when results are statistically significant. Poor safety reporting can lead to misinterpretation and inadequate conclusions about the interventions assessed. Our aim was to describe the reporting of harm-related results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

METHODS:We searched the MEDLINE database for reports of RCTs published from January 1, 2006, through January 1, 2007, in 6 general medical journals with a high impact factor. Data were extracted by use of a standardized form to appraise the presentation of safety results in text and tables.

RESULTS:Adverse events were mentioned in 88.7{\%} of the 133 reports. No information on severe adverse events and withdrawal of patients owing to an adverse event was given in 27.1{\%} and 47.4{\%} of articles, respectively. Restrictions in the reporting of harm-related data were noted in 43 articles (32.3{\%}) with a description of the most common adverse events only (n = 17), severe adverse events only (n = 16), statistically significant events only (n = 5), and a combination of restrictions (n = 5). The population considered for safety analysis was clearly reported in 65.6{\%} of articles.

CONCLUSION:Our review reveals important heterogeneity and variability in the reporting of harm-related results in publications of RCTs.},

abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or "batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes ( {\textgreater} 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice. Software for our method is freely available at: http://biosun1.harvard.edu/complab/batch/.},

It has two functional domains: an N-terminal 73-amino-acid RNA-binding domain and a C-terminal effector domain. Here, the crystallographic structure of the NS1A effector domain of influenza A/Udorn/72 virus is presented. Structure comparison with the NS1 effector domain from mouse-adapted influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) virus strain reveals a similar monomer conformation but a different dimer interface. Further analysis and evaluation shows that the dimer interface observed in the structure of the PR8 NS1 effector domain is likely to be a crystallographic packing effect.

abstract = {UNLABELLED: The recent global resurgence of arthritogenic alphaviruses, in particular chikungunya virus (CHIKV), highlights an urgent need for the development of therapeutic intervention strategies. While there has been significant progress in defining the pathophysiology of alphaviral disease, relatively little is known about the mechanisms involved in CHIKV-induced arthritis or potential therapeutic options to treat the severe arthritic symptoms associated with infection. Here, we used microcomputed tomographic ($\mu$CT) and histomorphometric analyses to provide previously undescribed evidence of reduced bone volume in the proximal tibial epiphysis of CHIKV-infected mice compared to the results for mock controls. This was associated with a significant increase in the receptor activator of nuclear factor-$\kappa$B ligand/osteoprotegerin (RANKL/OPG) ratio in infected murine joints and in the serum of CHIKV patients. The expression levels of the monocyte chemoattractant proteins (MCPs), including MCP-1/CCL2, MCP-2/CCL8, and MCP-3/CCL7, were also highly elevated in joints of CHIKV-infected mice, accompanied by increased cellularity within the bone marrow in tibial epiphysis and ankle joints. Both this effect and CHIKV-induced bone loss were significantly reduced by treatment with the MCP inhibitor bindarit. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a unique role for MCPs in promoting CHIKV-induced osteoclastogenesis and bone loss during disease and suggest that inhibition of MCPs with bindarit may be an effective therapy for patients affected with alphavirus-induced bone loss.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIMPORTANCE: Arthritogenic alphaviruses, including chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Ross River virus (RRV), cause worldwide outbreaks of polyarthritis, which can persist in patients for months following infection. Previous studies have shown that host proinflammatory soluble factors are associated with CHIKV disease severity. Furthermore, it is established that chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2/MCP-1) is important in cellular recruitment and inducing bone-resorbing osteoclast (OC) formation. Here, we show that CHIKV replicates in bone and triggers bone loss by increasing the RANKL/OPG ratio. CHIKV infection results in MCP-induced cellular infiltration in the inflamed joints, and bone loss can be ameliorated by treatment with an MCP-inhibiting drug, bindarit. Taken together, our data reveal a previously undescribed role for MCPs in CHIKV-induced bone loss: one of recruiting monocytes/OC precursors to joint sites and thereby favoring a pro-osteoclastic microenvironment. This suggests that bindarit may be an effective treatment for alphavirus-induced bone loss and arthritis in humans.},

abstract = {Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and MCP-2, two closely related CC chemokines, are important mediators of monocyte and lymphocyte migration. These chemokines are secreted by various normal cell types, including fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and leukocytes, as well as by tumor cells. After stimulation with different cytokines and cytokine inducers the MCP-2 production levels are always lower than those of MCP-1. In human diploid fibroblasts cytokines differentially regulate chemokine induction, interleukin (IL)-1beta and interferon (IFN)-gamma being potent stimuli of MCP-1 and MCP-2, respectively. Co-stimulation of fibroblasts by 10 U/mL IL-1beta and 20 ng/mL IFN-gamma resulted in a synergistic induction of MCP-2, whereas the combined effect on MCP-1 and IL-6 production was rather additive. These findings were confirmed at the mRNA level by Northern blot analysis. In contrast, in human MG-63 fibroblastoid cells and HEp-2 epithelial cells, selected for their poor responsiveness to IL-1beta and IFN-gamma, MCP-2 as well as MCP-1 and IL-6 were synergistically induced, yielding protein levels that were increased 3- to 30-fold above the additive levels. When IFN-beta was used as a co-stimulant of IL-1beta, a similar synergistic induction of MCP-1 and MCP-2 was measured both at the protein and the mRNA level. It can be concluded that, when synergy occurred, the MCP-1 and MCP-2 expression levels reached a comparable maximum, indicative for an equal contribution of these chemokines in normal and pathological conditions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Appropriate antibiotic treatment decreases mortality, while superfluous treatment is associated with antibiotic resistance. We built a computerized decision support system for antibiotic treatment (TREAT) targeting these outcomes.

METHODS: Prospective cohort study comparing TREAT's advice to physician's treatment followed by a cluster randomized trial comparing wards using TREAT (intervention) versus antibiotic monitoring without TREAT (control). We included patients suspected of harbouring bacterial infections in three hospitals (Israel, Germany and Italy). The primary outcome, appropriate antibiotic treatment, was assessed among patients with microbiologically documented infections (MDI). Length of hospital stay, adverse events, mortality (interventional trial) and antibiotic costs (both studies), including costs related to future antibiotic resistance, were compared among all included patients.

RESULTS: Among 1203 patients included in the cohort study (350 with MDI), TREAT prescribed appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment significantly more frequently than physicians (70{\%} versus 57{\%}, P {\textless} 0.001) using less broad-spectrum antibiotics at half physicians' antibiotic costs. The randomized trial included 2326 patients, 570 with MDI. The rate of appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was higher in intervention versus control wards [73{\%} versus 64{\%}, odds ratio (OR): 1.48, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.95-2.29, intention to treat, adjusted for location and clustering]. For patients treated according to TREAT's advice in intervention wards, the difference with controls was highly significant (OR: 3.40, 95{\%} CI: 2.25-5.14). Length of hospital stay, costs related to future resistance and total antibiotic costs were lower in intervention versus control wards.

CONCLUSIONS: TREAT improved the rate of appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment while reducing antibiotic costs and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA-Seq has emerged as the standard for measuring gene expression and is an important technique often used in studies of human disease. Gene expression quantification involves comparison of the sequenced reads to a known genomic or transcriptomic reference. The accuracy of that quantification relies on there being enough unique information in the reads to enable bioinformatics tools to accurately assign the reads to the correct gene. RESULTS: We apply 12 common methods to estimate gene expression from RNA-Seq data and show that there are hundreds of genes whose expression is underestimated by one or more of those methods. Many of these genes have been implicated in human disease, and we describe their roles. We go on to propose a two-stage analysis of RNA-Seq data in which multi-mapped or ambiguous reads can instead be uniquely assigned to groups of genes. We apply this method to a recently published mouse cancer study, and demonstrate that we can extract relevant biological signal from data that would otherwise have been discarded. CONCLUSIONS: For hundreds of genes in the human genome, RNA-Seq is unable to measure expression accurately. These genes are enriched for gene families, and many of them have been implicated in human disease. We show that it is possible to use data that may otherwise have been discarded to measure group-level expression, and that such data contains biologically relevant information.},

abstract = {The spread of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains in the clinical environment has begun to pose serious limits to treatment options. Yet virtually nothing is known about how resistance traits are acquired in vivo. Here, we apply the power of whole-genome sequencing to identify steps in the evolution of multidrug resistance in isogenic S. aureus isolates recovered periodically from the bloodstream of a patient undergoing chemotherapy with vancomycin and other antibiotics. After extensive therapy, the bacterium developed resistance, and treatment failed. Sequencing the first vancomycin susceptible isolate and the last vancomycin nonsusceptible isolate identified genome wide only 35 point mutations in 31 loci. These mutations appeared in a sequential order in isolates that were recovered at intermittent times during chemotherapy in parallel with increasing levels of resistance. The vancomycin nonsusceptible isolates also showed a 100-fold decrease in susceptibility to daptomycin, although this antibiotic was not used in the therapy. One of the mutated loci associated with decreasing vancomycin susceptibility (the vraR operon) was found to also carry mutations in six additional vancomycin nonsusceptible S. aureus isolates belonging to different genetic backgrounds and recovered from different geographic sites. As costs drop, whole-genome sequencing will become a useful tool in elucidating complex pathways of in vivo evolution in bacterial pathogens.},

We characterize the fecal, oral, and skin bacterial microbiome and resistome of members of an isolated Yanomami Amerindian village with no documented previous contact with Western people. These Yanomami harbor a microbiome with the highest diversity of bacteria and genetic functions ever reported in a human group. Despite their isolation, presumably for {\textgreater}11,000 years since their ancestors arrived in South America, and no known exposure to antibiotics, they harbor bacteria that carry functional antibiotic resistance (AR) genes, including those that confer resistance to synthetic antibiotics and are syntenic with mobilization elements. These results suggest that westernization significantly affects human microbiome diversity and that functional AR genes appear to be a feature of the human microbiome even in the absence of exposure to commercial antibiotics. AR genes are likely poised for mobilization and enrichment upon exposure to pharmacological levels of antibiotics. Our findings emphasize the need for extensive characterization of the function of the microbiome and resistome in remote nonwesternized populations before globalization of modern practices affects potentially beneficial bacteria harbored in the human body.},

The regimens differed by: (1) frequency of administration on first day (once vs twice); (2) duration of administration (1 day vs 8 days); (3) route of administration (intramuscular [IM] injection alone or followed by oral administration). In all regimens, BALB/c mice were administered 30 mg/kg peramivir IM 1 h after lethal challenge with 5 MLD(50) of A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) influenza virus. When given only on the day of inoculation, a single IM injection produced a 33{\%} survival rate, which increased to 55{\%} with two injections. Eight-day regimens significantly increased survival; two IM injections followed by seven daily IM injections was the most effective regimen (100{\%} survival; inhibition of replication in lungs and brain). When this 8-day regimen began at 24h after inoculation, 78{\%} of mice survived; 56{\%} survived when treatment began at 48 hours. Anti-HA antibody titer differed with the peramivir regimen and corresponded to the severity of disease. Overall, our results demonstrate that IM administration of peramivir is effective in promoting the survival of mice infected with systemically replicating H5N1 virus.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput sequencing technologies, such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer, are powerful new tools for investigating a wide range of biological and medical questions. Statistical and computational methods are key for drawing meaningful and accurate conclusions from the massive and complex datasets generated by the sequencers. We provide a detailed evaluation of statistical methods for normalization and differential expression (DE) analysis of Illumina transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-Seq) data.

RESULTS: We compare statistical methods for detecting genes that are significantly DE between two types of biological samples and find that there are substantial differences in how the test statistics handle low-count genes. We evaluate how DE results are affected by features of the sequencing platform, such as, varying gene lengths, base-calling calibration method (with and without phi X control lane), and flow-cell/library preparation effects. We investigate the impact of the read count normalization method on DE results and show that the standard approach of scaling by total lane counts (e.g., RPKM) can bias estimates of DE. We propose more general quantile-based normalization procedures and demonstrate an improvement in DE detection.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results have significant practical and methodological implications for the design and analysis of mRNA-Seq experiments. They highlight the importance of appropriate statistical methods for normalization and DE inference, to account for features of the sequencing platform that could impact the accuracy of results. They also reveal the need for further research in the development of statistical and computational methods for mRNA-Seq.},

The CHIK vaccine strain 181/clone25 (181/25) developed by the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) was shown to be well-tolerated and highly immunogenic in phase I and II clinical trials although it induced transient arthralgia in some healthy adult volunteers. In an attempt to better understand the host factors that are involved in the attenuating phenotype of CHIK 181/25 vaccine virus we conducted studies in interferon (IFN)-compromised mice and also evaluated its immunogenic potential and protective capacity. Infection of AG129 mice (defective in IFN-$\alpha$/$\beta$ and IFN-$\gamma$ receptor signaling) with CHIK 181/25 resulted in rapid mortality within 3-4 days. In contrast, all infected A129 mice (defective in IFN-$\alpha$/$\beta$ receptor signaling) survived with temporary morbidity characterized by ruffled appearance and body weight loss. A129 heterozygote mice that retain partial IFN-$\alpha$/$\beta$ receptor signaling activity remained healthy. Infection of A129 mice with CHIK 181/25 induced significant levels of IFN-$\gamma$ and IL-12 while the inflammatory cytokines, TNF$\alpha$ and IL-6 remained low. A single administration of the CHIK 181/25 vaccine provided both short-term and long-term protection (38 days and 247 days post-prime, respectively) against challenge with wt CHIKV-La Reunion (CHIKV-LR). This protection was at least partially mediated by antibodies since passively transferred immune serum protected both A129 and AG129 mice from wt CHIKV-LR and 181/25 virus challenge. Overall, these data highlight the importance of IFNs in controlling CHIK 181/25 vaccine and demonstrate the ability of this vaccine to elicit neutralizing antibody responses that confer short-and long-term protection against wt CHIKV-LR challenge. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have become an increasingly important approach for eukaryotic geneticists, facilitating the identification of hundreds of genetic polymorphisms that are responsible for inherited diseases. Despite the relative simplicity of bacterial genomes, the application of GWASs to identify polymorphisms responsible for important bacterial phenotypes has only recently been made possible through advances in genome sequencing technologies. Bacterial GWASs are now about to come of age thanks to the availability of massive datasets, and because of the potential to bridge genomics and traditional genetic approaches that is provided by improving validation strategies. A small number of pioneering GWASs in bacteria have been published in the past 2years, examining from 75 to more than 3,000 strains. The experimental designs have been diverse, taking advantage of different processes in bacteria for generating variation. Analysis of data from bacterial GWASs can, to some extent, be performed using software developed for eukaryotic systems, but there are important differences in genome evolution that must be considered. The greatest experimental advantage of bacterial GWASs is the potential to perform downstream validation of causality and dissection of mechanism. We review the recent advances and remaining challenges in this field and propose strategies to improve the validation of bacterial GWASs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Finding genes that are differentially expressed between conditions is an integral part of understanding the molecular basis of phenotypic variation. In the past decades, DNA microarrays have been used extensively to quantify the abundance of mRNA corresponding to different genes, and more recently high-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful competitor. As the cost of sequencing decreases, it is conceivable that the use of RNA-seq for differential expression analysis will increase rapidly. To exploit the possibilities and address the challenges posed by this relatively new type of data, a number of software packages have been developed especially for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We conducted an extensive comparison of eleven methods for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data. All methods are freely available within the R framework and take as input a matrix of counts, i.e. the number of reads mapping to each genomic feature of interest in each of a number of samples. We evaluate the methods based on both simulated data and real RNA-seq data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Very small sample sizes, which are still common in RNA-seq experiments, impose problems for all evaluated methods and any results obtained under such conditions should be interpreted with caution. For larger sample sizes, the methods combining a variance-stabilizing transformation with the 'limma' method for differential expression analysis perform well under many different conditions, as does the nonparametric SAMseq method.},

abstract = {Importance Tracheal intubation is common during pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest, although the relationship between intubation during cardiac arrest and outcomes is unknown. Objective To determine if intubation during pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest is associated with improved outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants Observational study of data from United States hospitals in the Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation registry. Pediatric patients ({\textless}18 years) with index in-hospital cardiac arrest between January 2000 and December 2014 were included. Patients who were receiving assisted ventilation, had an invasive airway in place, or both at the time chest compressions were initiated were excluded. Exposures Tracheal intubation during cardiac arrest . Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included return of spontaneous circulation and neurologic outcome. A favorable neurologic outcome was defined as a score of 1 to 2 on the pediatric cerebral performance category score. Patients being intubated at any given minute were matched with patients at risk of being intubated within the same minute (ie, still receiving resuscitation) based on a time-dependent propensity score calculated from multiple patient, event, and hospital characteristics. Results The study included 2294 patients; 1308 (57{\%}) were male, and all age groups were represented (median age, 7 months [25th-75th percentiles, 21 days, 4 years]). Of the 2294 included patients, 1555 (68{\%}) were intubated during the cardiac arrest. In the propensity score-matched cohort (n = 2270), survival was lower in those intubated compared with those not intubated (411/1135 [36{\%}] vs 460/1135 [41{\%}]; risk ratio [RR], 0.89 [95{\%} CI, 0.81-0.99]; P = .03). There was no significant difference in return of spontaneous circulation (770/1135 [68{\%}] vs 771/1135 [68{\%}]; RR, 1.00 [95{\%} CI, 0.95-1.06]; P = .96) or favorable neurologic outcome (185/987 [19{\%}] vs 211/983 [21{\%}]; RR, 0.87 [95{\%} CI, 0.75-1.02]; P = .08) between those intubated and not intubated. The association between intubation and decreased survival was observed in the majority of the sensitivity and subgroup analyses, including when accounting for missing data and in a subgroup of patients with a pulse at the beginning of the event. Conclusions and Relevance Among pediatric patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest, tracheal intubation during cardiac arrest compared with no intubation was associated with decreased survival to hospital discharge. Although the study design does not eliminate the potential for confounding, these findings do not support the current emphasis on early tracheal intubation for pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest.},

abstract = {Mice carrying mutations in multiple genes are traditionally generated by sequential recombination in embryonic stem cells and/or time-consuming intercrossing of mice with a single mutation. The CRISPR/Cas system has been adapted as an efficient gene-targeting technology with the potential for multiplexed genome editing. We demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene editing allows the simultaneous disruption of five genes (Tet1, 2, 3, Sry, Uty - 8 alleles) in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells with high efficiency. Coinjection of Cas9 mRNA and single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting Tet1 and Tet2 into zygotes generated mice with biallelic mutations in both genes with an efficiency of 80{\%}. Finally, we show that coinjection of Cas9 mRNA/sgRNAs with mutant oligos generated precise point mutations simultaneously in two target genes. Thus, the CRISPR/Cas system allows the one-step generation of animals carrying mutations in multiple genes, an approach that will greatly accelerate the in vivo study of functionally redundant genes and of epistatic gene interactions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

We used patterns of polymorphisms in functionally annotated regions in 1092 humans to identify deleterious variants; then we experimentally validated candidates. We analyzed both coding and noncoding regions, with the former corroborating the latter. We found regions particularly sensitive to mutations ("ultrasensitive") and variants that are disruptive because of mechanistic effects on transcription-factor binding (that is, "motif-breakers"). We also found variants in regions with higher network centrality tend to be deleterious. Insertions and deletions followed a similar pattern to single-nucleotide variants, with some notable exceptions (e.g., certain deletions and enhancers).

abstract = {The NS1 protein of the influenza A virus is a potent virulence factor that inhibits type I interferon (IFN) synthesis, allowing the virus to overcome host defenses and replicate efficiently. However, limited studies have been conducted on NS1 function using human virus strains and primary human cells. We used NS1 truncated mutant influenza viruses derived from the human isolate influenza A/TX/91 (TX WT, where WT is wild type) to study the functions of NS1 in infected primary cells. Infection of primary differentiated human tracheo-bronchial epithelial cells with an NS1 truncated mutant demonstrated limited viral replication and enhanced type I IFN induction. Additionally, human dendritic cells (DCs) infected with human NS1 mutant viruses showed higher levels of activation and stimulated na{\"{i}}ve T-cells better than TX WT virus-infected DCs. We also compared infections of DCs with TX WT and our previously characterized laboratory strain A/PR/8/34 (PR8) and its NS1 knockout strain, deltaNS1. TX WT-infected DCs displayed higher viral replication than PR8 but had decreased antiviral gene expression at late time points and reduced na{\"{i}}ve T-cell stimulation compared to PR8 infections, suggesting an augmented inhibition of IFN production and human DC activation. Our findings show that human-derived influenza A viruses have a high capacity to inhibit the antiviral state in a human system, and here we have evaluated the possible mechanism of this inhibition. Lastly, C-terminal truncations in the NS1 protein of human influenza virus are sufficient to make the virus attenuated and more immunogenic, supporting its use as a live attenuated influenza vaccine in humans.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Nanopore sequencing may be the next disruptive technology in genomics, owing to its ability to detect single DNA molecules without prior amplification, lack of reliance on expensive optical components, and the ability to sequence long fragments. The MinION™ from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) is the first nanopore sequencer to be commercialized and is now available to early-access users. The MinION™ is a USB-connected, portable nanopore sequencer that permits real-time analysis of streaming event data. Currently, the research community lacks a standardized toolkit for the analysis of nanopore datasets.

RESULTS: We introduce poretools, a flexible toolkit for exploring datasets generated by nanopore sequencing devices from MinION™ for the purposes of quality control and downstream analysis. Poretools operates directly on the native FAST5 (an application of the HDF5 standard) file format produced by ONT and provides a wealth of format conversion utilities and data exploration and visualization tools.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Poretools is an open-source software and is written in Python as both a suite of command line utilities and a Python application programming interface. Source code is freely available in Github at https://www.github.com/arq5x/poretools

@article{Miller2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genomic and other high dimensional analyses often require one to summarize multiple related variables by a single representative. This task is also variously referred to as collapsing, combining, reducing, or aggregating variables. Examples include summarizing several probe measurements corresponding to a single gene, representing the expression profiles of a co-expression module by a single expression profile, and aggregating cell-type marker information to de-convolute expression data. Several standard statistical summary techniques can be used, but network methods also provide useful alternative methods to find representatives. Currently few collapsing functions are developed and widely applied.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We introduce the R function collapseRows that implements several collapsing methods and evaluate its performance in three applications. First, we study a crucial step of the meta-analysis of microarray data: the merging of independent gene expression data sets, which may have been measured on different platforms. Toward this end, we collapse multiple microarray probes for a single gene and then merge the data by gene identifier. We find that choosing the probe with the highest average expression leads to best between-study consistency. Second, we study methods for summarizing the gene expression profiles of a co-expression module. Several gene co-expression network analysis applications show that the optimal collapsing strategy depends on the analysis goal. Third, we study aggregating the information of cell type marker genes when the aim is to predict the abundance of cell types in a tissue sample based on gene expression data ("expression deconvolution"). We apply different collapsing methods to predict cell type abundances in peripheral human blood and in mixtures of blood cell lines. Interestingly, the most accurate prediction method involves choosing the most highly connected "hub" marker gene. Finally, to facilitate biological interpretation of collapsed gene lists, we introduce the function userListEnrichment, which assesses the enrichment of gene lists for known brain and blood cell type markers, and for other published biological pathways.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The R function collapseRows implements several standard and network-based collapsing methods. In various genomic applications we provide evidence that both types of methods are robust and biologically relevant tools.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Computational and visual data analysis for genomics has traditionally involved a combination of tools and resources, of which the most ubiquitous consist of genome browsers, focused mainly on integrative visualization of large numbers of big datasets, and computational environments, focused on data modeling of a small number of moderately sized datasets. Workflows that involve the integration and exploration of multiple heterogeneous data sources, small and large, public and user specific have been poorly addressed by these tools. In our previous work, we introduced Epiviz, which bridges the gap between the two types of tools, simplifying these workflows.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In this paper we expand on the design decisions behind Epiviz, and introduce a series of new advanced features that further support the type of interactive exploratory workflow we have targeted. We discuss three ways in which Epiviz advances the field of genomic data analysis: 1) it brings code to interactive visualizations at various different levels; 2) takes the first steps in the direction of collaborative data analysis by incorporating user plugins from source control providers, as well as by allowing analysis states to be shared among the scientific community; 3) combines established analysis features that have never before been available simultaneously in a genome browser. In our discussion section, we present security implications of the current design, as well as a series of limitations and future research steps.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Since many of the design choices of Epiviz are novel in genomics data analysis, this paper serves both as a document of our own approaches with lessons learned, as well as a start point for future efforts in the same direction for the genomics community.},

abstract = {The original influenza virus strain A/USSR/90/77 (H 1 N 1) and its mouse-adapted variant, differing in their reactivity with anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal antibodies HC 22 and HC 124, were crossed in MDCK cells and in chicken embryos, and 21 clones were isolated by non-selective random cloning. In all the clones the virulence for mice was found to be linked to the antigenic specificity of hemagglutinin (HA). An independent marker, formation of filamentous forms, was reassorted with an expected frequency. In the crosses between UV-irradiated mouse-adapted variant and live non-adapted strain, with selection of clones by a mixture of monoclonal antibodies discriminating between HA of the two variants, virulence also was linked to HA gene. On the contrary, in the experiments with A/Aichi/2/68 (H 3 N 2) strain and its mouse-adapted highly virulent variant these two characteristics--virulence and HA antigenic specificity--could be dissociated. A pathogenic clone having HA of the non-adapted strain was readily obtained; its virulence, however, was weaker than that of the mouse-adapted parent. In the inter-subtypic crosses between A/USSR/90/77 and A/Aichi/2/68 the transfer of the HA gene of the mouse-adapted A/Aichi/2/68 did not confer virulence to the reassortant. The results are discussed in terms of the genetic basis of virulence acquired in the course of influenza virus adaptation to a new host.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The deposition of intracellular and extracellular beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) in the brain is a pathologic feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. However, the exact role of the Abeta peptide in causing AD's symptoms is unclear. MATERIAL/METHODS: CRL-2266 SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells (ATCC, USA) and HTB-11 human neuroblastoma cells (ATCC, USA) were cultured. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to analyze the effects of beta25-35, morphine, and SNAP treatments upon BACE-1 and BACE-2 mRNA expression semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The production of NO in SH-SY5Y cells was detected using the Apollo 4000 Free Radical Analyzer (World Precision Instruments). RESULTS: Untreated HTB-11 neuroblastoma cells constitutively express BACE-1 and BACE-2 mRNA. Morphine down regulates the expression of BACE-1 and up regulates the expression of BACE-2 in a naloxone antagonizable manner. When HTB-11 cells were treated with L-NAME, a cNOS inhibitor; the effects of morphine were blocked. SNAP (a NO donor) mimicked the effect of morphine. In SH-SY5Y cells, Abeta treated cells show a dose-dependent decrease in NO release, demonstrating that Ab is dose-dependently inhibiting the release of constitutive NO. CONCLUSIONS: Ab and morphine/NO each inhibit the production of the other. This suggests that a deficiency of basal NO or endogenous morphine may trigger drastically reduced levels of basal NO. The outcome is chronic vasoconstriction and brain hypoperfusion and eventual neuronal death. This novel theorized mechanism for AD supports an increasingly-accepted vascular pathological hypothesis for the disease.},

The three phases of the study include the development of the tool, prospective testing of the validity of the tool using 1468 patients in a medical assessment unit and external retrospective testing using data from 29 425 patients. In the first phase of the study, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified the Waterlow assessment score as having the ability to predict CDAD (area under the curve: 0.827). The Waterlow tool was then tested prospectively with 1468 patients admitted to a medical assessment unit. A total of 1385 patients (94{\%}) had a Waterlow score {\textless}20 and 83 patients (6{\%}) had a Waterlow score of ≥20. After a three-month follow-up, six patients in the low Waterlow score group developed CDAD (0.4{\%}) and 14 patients in the high score group developed CDAD (17{\%}). The sensitivity and specificity of the Waterlow score to predict the risk of developing CDAD were 70{\%} and 95{\%}, respectively. Similar results were obtained when the tool was tested retrospectively on a large external patient data set. The Waterlow score appears to predict patients' risk of developing CDAD and although it did not identify all cases, it highlighted a small group of patients who had a disproportionately large number of CDAD cases. The Waterlow score can be used to target patients most at risk of developing CDAD. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Hospital Infection Society.},

Notably, BLAST analysis results obtained using the rmtF gene sequence (a new aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme gene sequence that is not included in the database) as a query revealed that the tool was able to link this sequence to short sequences (17 to 40 bp) found in other genes of the rmt family with significant E values. Finally, the analysis of 178 Acinetobacter baumannii and 20 Staphylococcus aureus genomes allowed the detection of a significantly higher number of AR genes than the Resfinder gene analyzer and 11 point mutations in target genes known to be associated with AR. The average time for the analysis of a genome was 3.35 ± 0.13 min. We have created a concise database for BLAST using a Bio-Edit interface that can detect AR genetic determinants in bacterial genomes and can rapidly and easily discover putative new AR genetic determinants.},

abstract = {Insertion sequences (ISs) are small DNA segments that are often capable of moving neighbouring genes. Over 1500 different ISs have been identified to date. They can have large and spectacular effects in shaping and reshuffling the bacterial genome. Recent studies have provided dramatic examples of such IS activity, including massive IS expansion during the emergence of some pathogenic bacterial species and the intimate involvement of ISs in assembling genes into complex plasmid structures. However, a global understanding of their impact on bacterial genomes requires detailed knowledge of their distribution across the eubacterial and archaeal kingdoms, understanding their partition between chromosomes and extra-chromosomal elements (e.g. plasmids and viruses) and the factors which influence this, and appreciation of the different transposition mechanisms in action, the target preferences and the host factors that influence transposition. In addition, defective (non- autonomous) elements, which can be complemented by related active elements in the same cell, are often overlooked in genome annotations but also contribute to the evolution of genome organisation.},

Most previous research has focused on individual brain regions and genes contributing to depression. However, emerging evidence in humans and animal models suggests that dysregulated circuit function and gene expression across multiple brain regions drive depressive phenotypes. Here, we performed RNA sequencing on four brain regions from control animals and those susceptible or resilient to chronic social defeat stress at multiple time points. We employed an integrative network biology approach to identify transcriptional networks and key driver genes that regulate susceptibility to depressive-like symptoms. Further, we validated in vivo several key drivers and their associated transcriptional networks that regulate depression susceptibility and confirmed their functional significance at the levels of gene transcription, synaptic regulation, and behavior. Our study reveals novel transcriptional networks that control stress susceptibility and offers fundamentally new leads for antidepressant drug discovery.},

To assess the impact of CDI on mortality, hospital costs, healthcare use, and Medicare payments for beneficiaries who were discharged with CDI listed as a secondary International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification claim diagnosis. Methods: Data were analyzed from the 2009 to 2010 5{\%} random sample Medicare Standard Analytic Files of beneficiary claims. Patients with index hospitalizations with CDI as a secondary diagnosis and no previous hospitalization within 30 days were identified. Outcomes included inpatient and 30-day mortality, inpatient costs, index hospital payments, all-provider payments, net hospital losses, payment to cost ratio, length of stay (LOS), and 30-day readmission; outcomes were each risk adjusted using propensity score matching and regression modeling techniques. Results: A total of 3262 patients with CDI were identified after matching to patients without a CDI diagnosis. After risk adjustment, secondary CDI was associated with statistically significantly (all P {\textless} 0.05) greater inpatient mortality (3.1{\%} vs. 1.7{\%}), 30-day mortality (4.1{\%} vs. 2.2{\%}), longer LOS (7.0 days vs. 3.8 days), higher rates of 30-day hospital readmissions (14.8{\%} vs. 10.4{\%}), and greater hospital costs ({\$}16,184 vs. {\$}13,954) compared with the non-CDI cohort. The risk-adjusted payment-to-cost ratio was shown to be lower for patients with CDI than those without (0.76 vs. 0.85). Conclusions: Secondary CDI is associated with greater adjusted mortality, costs, LOS, and hospital readmissions, while receiving similar hospital reimbursement compared with patients without CDI in a Medicare population.},

The application of this technology to the longitudinal study of adaptation in an infected host-in particular, the evolution of drug resistance and host adaptation in patients who are chronically infected with opportunistic pathogens-has revealed remarkable patterns of convergent evolution, suggestive of an inherent repeatability of evolution. In this Review, we describe how these studies have advanced our understanding of the mechanisms and principles of within-host genome evolution, and we consider the consequences of findings such as a potent adaptive potential for pathogenicity. Finally, we discuss the possibility that genomics may be used in the future to predict the clinical progression of bacterial infections and to suggest the best option for treatment.},

The availability of new platforms, allowing detection of increasing numbers of cell surface markers, has challenged the traditional technique of identifying cell populations by manual gating and resulted in a growing need for the development of automated, high-dimensional analytical methods. We present a direct multivariate finite mixture modeling approach, using skew and heavy-tailed distributions, to address the complexities of flow cytometric analysis and to deal with high-dimensional cytometric data without the need for projection or transformation.

abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV) is an important emerging neurotropic virus, responsible for increasingly severe encephalitis outbreaks in humans and horses worldwide. However, the mechanism by which the virus gains entry to the brain (neuroinvasion) remains poorly understood. Hypotheses of hematogenous and transneural entry have been proposed for WNV neuroinvasion, which revolve mainly around the concepts of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and retrograde axonal transport, respectively. However, an over‑representation of in vitro studies without adequate in vivo validation continues to obscure our understanding of the mechanism(s). Furthermore, WNV infection in the current rodent models does not generate a similar viremia and character of CNS infection, as seen in the common target hosts, humans and horses. These differences ultimately question the applicability of rodent models for pathogenesis investigations. Finally, the role of several barriers against CNS insults, such as the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the CSF-brain and the blood-spinal cord barriers, remain largely unexplored, highlighting the infancy of this field. In this review, a systematic and critical appraisal of the current evidence relevant to the possible mechanism(s) of WNV neuroinvasion is conducted.},

abstract = {Flow cytometry is used increasingly in clinical research for cancer, immunology and vaccines. Technological advances in cytometry instrumentation are increasing the size and dimensionality of data sets, posing a challenge for traditional data management and analysis. Automated analysis methods, despite a general consensus of their importance to the future of the field, have been slow to gain widespread adoption. Here we present OpenCyto, a new BioConductor infrastructure and data analysis framework designed to lower the barrier of entry to automated flow data analysis algorithms by addressing key areas that we believe have held back wider adoption of automated approaches. OpenCyto supports end-to-end data analysis that is robust and reproducible while generating results that are easy to interpret. We have improved the existing, widely used core BioConductor flow cytometry infrastructure by allowing analysis to scale in a memory efficient manner to the large flow data sets that arise in clinical trials, and integrating domain-specific knowledge as part of the pipeline through the hierarchical relationships among cell populations. Pipelines are defined through a text-based csv file, limiting the need to write data-specific code, and are data agnostic to simplify repetitive analysis for core facilities. We demonstrate how to analyze two large cytometry data sets: an intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) data set from a published HIV vaccine trial focused on detecting rare, antigen-specific T-cell populations, where we identify a new subset of CD8 T-cells with a vaccine-regimen specific response that could not be identified through manual analysis, and a CyTOF T-cell phenotyping data set where a large staining panel and many cell populations are a challenge for traditional analysis. The substantial improvements to the core BioConductor flow cytometry packages give OpenCyto the potential for wide adoption. It can rapidly leverage new developments in computational cytometry and facilitate reproducible analysis in a unified environment.},

abstract = {Monocyte chemotactic proteins (MCP) belong to a group of structurally and functionally related factors, called chemokines. To facilitate additional characterization of the recently identified MCP-2, the 76-residue protein was chemically synthesized. The synthetic 7-kDa monomeric protein was chemotactic for monocytes at 1 nM and was biochemically similar to natural MCP-2. Sensitive radioimmunoassays for both MCP-1 and MCP-2 were developed. These RIAs were specific in that no cross-reactivity could be observed, and other chemokines or cytokines were not detected. Induction of MCP-1 and MCP-2 in human diploid fibroblasts and peripheral blood leukocytes as well as osteosarcoma, epidermal carcinoma, and melanoma cells by the cytokines IL-1 beta, IFN-beta, and IFN-gamma and cytokine inducers such as dsRNA, virus, endotoxin, mitogen, and phorbol ester was studied. In connective tissue cells, IL-1 beta was the best inducer of MCP-1, but IFN-gamma was a superior inducer of MCP-2. Mononuclear cells also proved to be a source of MCP-1 and MCP-2 when stimulated by most of the inducers tested. Granulocytes, however, were inefficient producers. Measles virus induced MCP-1 and MCP-2 in most cell types. In general, the yields of MCP-2 were at least 10-fold lower than those of MCP-1. It is concluded that, although MCP-2 is often coproduced with MCP-1, regulation of expression of the two chemokines is not identical. It remains to be studied under which pathological conditions MCP-2 is released in vivo and whether MCP-1 and MCP-2 can activate different target cells.},

abstract = {The IFN-induced resistance factor Mx1 is a critical component of innate immunity against influenza A viruses (FLUAV) in mice. Animals carrying a wild-type Mx1 gene (Mx1(+/+)) differ from regular laboratory mice (Mx1(-/-)) in that they are highly resistant to infection with standard FLUAV strains. We identified an extraordinary variant of the FLUAV strain, A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (designated hvPR8), which is unusually virulent in Mx1(+/+) mice. hvPR8 was well controlled in Mx1(+/+) but not Mx1(-/-) mice provided that the animals were treated with IFN before infection, indicating that hvPR8 exhibits normal sensitivity to growth restriction by Mx1. hvPR8 multiplied much faster than standard PR8 early in infection because of highly efficient viral gene expression in infected cells. Studies with reassortant viruses containing defined genome segments of both hvPR8 and standard PR8 demonstrated that the HA, neuraminidase, and polymerase genes of hvPR8 all contributed to virulence, indicating that efficient host cell entry and early gene expression renders hvPR8 highly pathogenic. These results reveal a surprisingly simple concept of how influenza viruses may gain virulence and illustrate that high speed of virus growth can outcompete the antiviral response of the infected host.},

abstract = {Genetic variants that are associated with common human diseases do not lead directly to disease, but instead act on intermediate, molecular phenotypes that in turn induce changes in higher-order disease traits. Therefore, identifying the molecular phenotypes that vary in response to changes in DNA and that also associate with changes in disease traits has the potential to provide the functional information required to not only identify and validate the susceptibility genes that are directly affected by changes in DNA, but also to understand the molecular networks in which such genes operate and how changes in these networks lead to changes in disease traits. Toward that end, we profiled more than 39,000 transcripts and we genotyped 782,476 unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in more than 400 human liver samples to characterize the genetic architecture of gene expression in the human liver, a metabolically active tissue that is important in a number of common human diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. This genome-wide association study of gene expression resulted in the detection of more than 6,000 associations between SNP genotypes and liver gene expression traits, where many of the corresponding genes identified have already been implicated in a number of human diseases. The utility of these data for elucidating the causes of common human diseases is demonstrated by integrating them with genotypic and expression data from other human and mouse populations. This provides much-needed functional support for the candidate susceptibility genes being identified at a growing number of genetic loci that have been identified as key drivers of disease from genome-wide association studies of disease. By using an integrative genomics approach, we highlight how the gene RPS26 and not ERBB3 is supported by our data as the most likely susceptibility gene for a novel type 1 diabetes locus recently identified in a large-scale, genome-wide association study. We also identify SORT1 and CELSR2 as candidate susceptibility genes for a locus recently associated with coronary artery disease and plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the process.},

However, probing signaling in epithelial tissues using cytometry-based single-cell analysis has been confounded by the necessity of single-cell dissociation, where disrupting cell-to-cell connections inherently perturbs native cell signaling states. Here, we demonstrate a novel strategy (Disaggregation for Intracellular Signaling in Single Epithelial Cells from Tissue-DISSECT) that preserves native signaling for Cytometry Time-of-Flight (CyTOF) and fluorescent flow cytometry applications. A 21-plex CyTOF analysis encompassing core signaling and cell-identity markers was performed on the small intestinal epithelium after systemic tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-$\alpha$) stimulation. Unsupervised and supervised analyses robustly selected signaling features that identify a unique subset of epithelial cells that are sensitized to TNF-$\alpha$-induced apoptosis in the seemingly homogeneous enterocyte population. Specifically, p-ERK and apoptosis are divergently regulated in neighboring enterocytes within the epithelium, suggesting a mechanism of contact-dependent survival. Our novel single-cell approach can broadly be applied, using both CyTOF and multi-parameter flow cytometry, for investigating normal and diseased cell states in a wide range of epithelial tissues.},

abstract = {Influenza virus produces a protein, NS1, that inhibits infected cells from releasing type I interferon (IFN) and blocks maturation of conventional dendritic cells (DCs). As a result, influenza virus is a poor activator of both mouse and human DCs in vitro. However, in vivo a strong immune response to virus infection is generated in both species, suggesting that other factors may contribute to the maturation of DCs in vivo. It is likely that the environment in which a DC encounters a virus would contain multiple pro-inflammatory molecules, including type I IFN. Type I IFN is a critical component of the viral immune response that initiates an antiviral state in cells, primarily by triggering a broad transcriptional program that interferes with the ability of virus to establish infection in the cell. In this study, we have examined the activation profiles of both conventional and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (cDCs and pDCs) in response to an influenza virus infection in the context of a type I IFN-containing environment. We found that both cDCs and pDCs demonstrate a greater activation response to influenza virus when pre-exposed to IFN-beta (IFN priming); although, the priming kinetics are different in these two cell types. This strongly suggests that type I IFN functions not only to reduce viral replication in these immune cells, but also to promote greater DC activation during influenza virus infections.},

abstract = {The host response to Chikungunya virus is dependent on the direct action of type I IFN on infected nonhematopoietic cells. Prior studies have demonstrated that multiple host sensors coordinate an antiviral response; however, the tissue source(s) and signaling pathways for IFN production remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that IRF-3 and IRF-7 are functionally redundant, but lack of both factors results in lethal infection in adult mice. Reciprocal bone marrow chimeras indicated that IRF-3 or IRF-7 expression in either hematopoietic or nonhemotopoietic cell compartments was capable of inducing an antiviral response. Interestingly, redundancy of IRF-3 and IRF-7 was age dependent, as neonatal animals lacking either factor succumbed to infection. We further demonstrate that IPS-1 is essential in nonhematopoietic cells and preferentially required during early life. These results highlight the interplay between nonimmune and immune cells during Chikungunya virus infection and suggest an important role for nonhematopoietic cells as a critical source of IFN-$\alpha$/$\beta$.},

Two types of antibiotic resistance gene discoveries will be discussed: the use of classic microbiological and molecular techniques, such as culturing and PCR, to identify known genes not previously reported in animals; and the application of high-throughput technologies, such as metagenomics, to identify novel genes and gene transfer mechanisms. These discoveries confirm that antibiotics should be limited to prudent uses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI) affects 10{\%} to 25{\%} of patients with initial CDI (iCDI). Initiation of new therapies that reduce recurrences rests on identifying patients at high risk for rCDI at iCDI onset. OBJECTIVE: To develop a predictive model for rCDI based on factors present at iCDI onset. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Large urban academic medical center. PATIENTS: All adult patients with an inpatient iCDI from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2009. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS: Positive toxin assay for C difficile with no C difficile infection in the previous 60 days constituted iCDI. Repeat positive toxin within 42 days of stopping iCDI treatment defined rCDI. Three demographic, 13 chronic, and 12 acute disease characteristics, and 7 processes of care prior to or at the onset of iCDI, were assessed for association with rCDI. A logistic regression model to identify predictors for rCDI was developed and cross-validated. RESULTS: Among the 4196 patients enrolled, 425 (10.1{\%}) developed rCDI. Six factors (case status as community-onset healthcare-associated, ≥2 hospitalizations in the prior 60 days, new gastric acid suppression, fluoroquinolone and high-risk antibiotic use at the onset of iCDI, age) predicted rCDI in multivariate analyses, whereas intensive care unit stay appeared protective. The model achieved moderate discrimination (C statistic 0.643) and calibration (Brier score 0.089). Its negative predictive value was 90{\%} or higher across a wide range of risk. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients hospitalized with rCDI, multiple factors present at the onset of iCDI increased the risk for rCDI. Recognizing patients at high-risk for rCDI can help clinicians tailor early treatment and prevention. Journal of Hospital Medicine 2014. {\textcopyright} 2014 Society of Hospital Medicine.},

In an effort to identifying such markers, we used influenza vaccination in 30 young (20-30 years) and 59 older subjects (60 to {\textgreater}89 years) as models for strong and weak immune responses, respectively, and assayed their serological responses to influenza strains as well as a wide variety of other parameters, including gene expression, antibodies to hemagglutinin peptides, serum cytokines, cell subset phenotypes and in vitro cytokine stimulation. Using machine learning, we identified nine variables that predict the antibody response with 84{\%} accuracy. Two of these variables are involved in apoptosis, which positively associated with the response to vaccination and was confirmed to be a contributor to vaccine responsiveness in mice. The identification of these biomarkers provides new insights into what immune features may be most important for immune health.},

In the context of the German health-care system, direct and indirect costs of an initial episode of CDAD and of CDAD recurrence are currently unknown.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We defined CDAD as presence of diarrhoea (≥3 unformed stools/day) in association with detection of Clostridium difficile toxin in an unformed faecal sample. Patients treated with metronidazole (PO or IV) and/or vancomycin (PO) were included. Comprehensive data of patients were retrospectively documented into a database using the technology of the Cologne Cohort of Neutropenic Patients (CoCoNut). Patients with CDAD were matched to control patients in a 1:1 ratio. Analysis was split in three groups: incidence group (CDAD patients without recurrence), recurrence group (CDAD patients with ≥1 recurrence) and control group (matched non-CDAD patients).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Between 02/2010 and 12/2011, 150 patients with CDAD (114 patients in the incidence and 36 (24 {\%}) in the recurrence group) and 150 controls were analysed. Mean length of stay was: 32 (95 {\%}CI: 30-37), 94 (95 {\%}CI: 76-112) and 24 days (95 {\%}CI: 22-27; P = {\textless}0.001), resulting in mean overall direct treatment costs per patient of €18,460 (95 {\%}CI: €14,660-€22,270), €73,900 (95 {\%}CI: €50,340-€97,460) and €14,530 (95 {\%}CI: €11,730-€17,330; P = {\textless}0.001). In the incidence and recurrence group, the mean cumulative number of antibiotic CDAD treatment days was 11 (95 {\%}CI: 10-12) and 36 (95 {\%}CI: 27-45; P = {\textless}0.001).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Especially CDAD recurrence was associated with excessive costs, which were mostly attributable to a significantly longer overall length of stay. Innovative treatment strategies are warranted to reduce treatment costs and prevent recurrence of CDAD.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Social networks have been used in the study of outbreaks of infectious diseases, including in small group settings such as individual hospitals. Collecting the data needed to create such networks, however, can be time consuming, costly, and error prone. We sought to create a social network of hospital inpatients using electronic medical record (EMR) data already collected for other purposes, for use in simulating outbreaks of nosocomial infections.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the EMR data warehouse of a tertiary academic hospital to model contact among inpatients. Patient-to-patient contact due to shared rooms was inferred from admission-discharge-transfer data, and contact with healthcare workers was inferred from clinical documents. Contacts were used to generate a social network, which was then used to conduct probabilistic simulations of nosocomial outbreaks of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and influenza.

RESULTS: Simulations of infection transmission across the network reflected the staffing and patient flow practices of the hospital. Simulations modeling patient isolation, increased hand hygiene, and staff vaccination showed a decrease in the spread of infection.

DISCUSSION: We developed a method of generating a social network of hospital inpatients from EMR data. This method allows the derivation of networks that reflect the local hospital environment, obviate the need for simulated or manually collected data, and can be updated in near real time.

CONCLUSIONS: Inpatient social networks represent a novel secondary use of EMR data, and can be used to simulate nosocomial infections. Future work should focus on prospective validation of the simulations, and adapting such networks to other tasks.},

METHODS: Whole exome and whole genome sequencing was performed on multiple technical replicates of five reference samples using the Illumina HiSeq 2000/2500. The sequencing data was processed with a GATK-based genome analysis pipeline to evaluate: intra-run, inter-run, inter-mode, inter-machine and inter-library consistency, concordance with orthogonal technologies (microarray, Sanger) and sensitivity and accuracy relative to known variant sets. RESULTS: Concordance to high-density microarrays consistently exceeds 97{\%} (and typically exceeds 99{\%}) and concordance between sequencing replicates also exceeds 97{\%}, with no observable differences between different flow cells, runs, machines or modes. Sensitivity relative to high-density microarray variants exceeds 95{\%}. In a detailed study of a 129 kb region, sensitivity was lower with some validated single-base insertions and deletions "not called". Different variants are "not called" in each replicate: of all variants identified in WES data from the NA12878 reference sample 74{\%} of indels and 89{\%} of SNVs were called in all seven replicates, in NA12878 WGS 52{\%} of indels and 88{\%} of SNVs were called in all six replicates. Key sources of non-uniformity are variance in depth of coverage, artifactual variants resulting from repetitive regions and larger structural variants. CONCLUSION: We report a comprehensive performance characterization of WES/WGS that will be relevant to offering laboratories, consumers of genome sequencing and others interested in the analytical validity of this technology.},

@article{Liu2013,
abstract = {Background On March 30, 2013, a novel avian influenza A H7N9 virus that infects human beings was identified. This virus had been detected in six provinces and municipal cities in China as of April 18, 2013. We correlated genomic sequences from avian influenza viruses with ecological information and did phylogenetic and coalescent analyses to extrapolate the potential origins of the virus and possible routes of reassortment events. Methods We downloaded H7N9 virus genome sequences from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database and public sequences used from the Influenza Virus Resource. We constructed phylogenetic trees and did 1000 bootstrap replicates for each tree. Two rounds of phylogenetic analyses were done. We used at least 100 closely related sequences for each gene to infer the overall topology, removed suspicious sequences from the trees, and focused on the closest clades to the novel H7N9 viruses. We compared our tree topologies with those from a bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees (BEAST) analysis. We used the bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method to jointly estimate phylogenies, divergence times, and other evolutionary parameters for all eight gene fragments. We used sequence alignment and homology-modelling methods to study specific mutations regarding phenotypes, specifically addressing the human receptor binding properties. Findings The novel avian influenza A H7N9 virus originated from multiple reassortment events. The HA gene might have originated from avian influenza viruses of duck origin, and the NA gene might have transferred from migratory birds infected with avian influenza viruses along the east Asian flyway. The six internal genes of this virus probably originated from two different groups of H9N2 avian influenza viruses, which were isolated from chickens. Detailed analyses also showed that ducks and chickens probably acted as the intermediate hosts leading to the emergence of this virulent H7N9 virus. Genotypic and potential phenotypic differences imply that the isolates causing this outbreak form two separate subclades. Interpretation The novel avian influenza A H7N9 virus might have evolved from at least four origins. Diversity among isolates implies that the H7N9 virus has evolved into at least two different lineages. Unknown intermediate hosts involved might be implicated, extensive global surveillance is needed, and domestic-poultry-to-person transmission should be closely watched in the future.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Finding genomic distance based on gene order is a classic problem in genome rearrangements. Efficient exact algorithms for genomic distances based on inversions and/or translocations have been found but are complicated by special cases, rare in simulations and empirical data. We seek a universal operation underlying a more inclusive set of evolutionary operations and yielding a tractable genomic distance with simple mathematical form. RESULTS: We study a universal double-cut-and-join operation that accounts for inversions, translocations, fissions and fusions, but also produces circular intermediates which can be reabsorbed. The genomic distance, computable in linear time, is given by the number of breakpoints minus the number of cycles (b-c) in the comparison graph of the two genomes; the number of hurdles does not enter into it. Without changing the formula, we can replace generation and re-absorption of a circular intermediate by a generalized transposition, equivalent to a block interchange, with weight two. Our simple algorithm converts one multi-linear chromosome genome to another in the minimum distance.},

@article{Krampis2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: A steep drop in the cost of next-generation sequencing during recent years has made the technology affordable to the majority of researchers, but downstream bioinformatic analysis still poses a resource bottleneck for smaller laboratories and institutes that do not have access to substantial computational resources. Sequencing instruments are typically bundled with only the minimal processing and storage capacity required for data capture during sequencing runs. Given the scale of sequence datasets, scientific value cannot be obtained from acquiring a sequencer unless it is accompanied by an equal investment in informatics infrastructure.

RESULTS: Cloud BioLinux is a publicly accessible Virtual Machine (VM) that enables scientists to quickly provision on-demand infrastructures for high-performance bioinformatics computing using cloud platforms. Users have instant access to a range of pre-configured command line and graphical software applications, including a full-featured desktop interface, documentation and over 135 bioinformatics packages for applications including sequence alignment, clustering, assembly, display, editing, and phylogeny. Each tool's functionality is fully described in the documentation directly accessible from the graphical interface of the VM. Besides the Amazon EC2 cloud, we have started instances of Cloud BioLinux on a private Eucalyptus cloud installed at the J. Craig Venter Institute, and demonstrated access to the bioinformatic tools interface through a remote connection to EC2 instances from a local desktop computer. Documentation for using Cloud BioLinux on EC2 is available from our project website, while a Eucalyptus cloud image and VirtualBox Appliance is also publicly available for download and use by researchers with access to private clouds.

CONCLUSIONS: Cloud BioLinux provides a platform for developing bioinformatics infrastructures on the cloud. An automated and configurable process builds Virtual Machines, allowing the development of highly customized versions from a shared code base. This shared community toolkit enables application specific analysis platforms on the cloud by minimizing the effort required to prepare and maintain them.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We report the detailed development of biomarkers to predict the clinical outcome under dengue infection. Transcriptional signatures from purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells were derived from whole-genome gene-expression microarray data, validated by quantitative PCR and tested in independent samples.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The study was performed on patients of a well-characterized dengue cohort from Recife, Brazil. The samples analyzed were collected prospectively from acute febrile dengue patients who evolved with different degrees of disease severity: classic dengue fever or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) samples were compared with similar samples from other non-dengue febrile illnesses. The DHF samples were collected 2-3 days before the presentation of the plasma leakage symptoms. Differentially-expressed genes were selected by univariate statistical tests as well as multivariate classification techniques. The results showed that at early stages of dengue infection, the genes involved in effector mechanisms of innate immune response presented a weaker activation on patients who later developed hemorrhagic fever, whereas the genes involved in apoptosis were expressed in higher levels.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Some of the gene expression signatures displayed estimated accuracy rates of more than 95{\%}, indicating that expression profiling with these signatures may provide a useful means of DHF prognosis at early stages of infection.},

Generally, either the server or the client is responsible for the majority of data processing, resulting in either servers having to receive and handle data relevant only to one user, or clients redundantly processing widely viewed data. ChromoZoom pre-renders and caches general-use tracks into tiled images on the server and serves them in an interactive web interface with inertial scrolling and precise, fluent zooming via the mouse wheel or trackpad. Custom tracks in several formats can be rendered by client-side code alongside the pre-rendered tracks, minimizing server load because of user-specific rendering and eliminating the need to transmit private data. ChromoZoom thereby enables rapid and simultaneous exploration of curated, experimental and personal genomic datasets.

abstract = {The N21I missense mutation in the cationic trypsinogen gene is the second most frequent mutation in hereditary pancreatitis (HP). In this article, we suggest that the N21I mutation most likely arose as a gene conversion event in which the functional anionic trypsinogen gene acted as the donor sequence. This hypothesis is supported by the unique presence of Ile at residue 21 of the anionic gene amongst the several highly homologous trypsinogen genes; a single unbroken tract of nucleotides of up to 113 bp flanking the I21 residue in the anionic trypsinogen gene; and the presence of a chi-like sequence in the 5' proximity and a palindromic sequence in the 3' vicinity of the N21I mutation. Furthermore, a multiple alignment of the partial amino acid sequence of vertebrate trypsins around residue 21 indicated that N21 and I21 may represent advantageously selected mutations of the two functional human trypsinogen genes in evolutionary history. These observations, which are complementary to the previous findings, provide further insights into the genetic mechanism and pathogenic role of the N21I mutation in HP.},

abstract = {Dengue is a positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family. There are four distinct serotypes — dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV1) to DENV4 — and several genotypes within each serotype. Since the 1950s, there has been considerable expansion in the geographic spread of dengue and an exponential rise in disease incidence. It is estimated that the annual global inci-dence is 390 million cases, of which 96 million are clinically apparent 1 . There are several factors that drive this pandemic, including globalization, the spread of the Aedes mosquito vector, inadequately planned urbaniza-tion and the absence of a licensed vaccine or anti-dengue therapeutics 2 . The clinical phenotype of dengue can vary depending on several factors, of which age, genetic predisposition and background immunity are major determinants. However, most clinical infections result in a self-limiting febrile illness termed dengue fever. The hall-mark feature of severe disease is increased capillary permeability, causing plasma leakage, which can lead to haemo dynamic compromise and dengue shock syn-drome (DSS) (BOX 1). If untreated, severe disease can lead to a mortality rate of up to 20{\%} of affected individuals but with expert management and primarily careful fluid replacement, this can be reduced to less than 1{\%} 2},

abstract = {The existing tools for estimating the risk of death in patients after they experience acute coronary syndrome are commonly based on echocardiography and clinical risk scores (for example, the TIMI risk score). These identify a small group of high-risk patients who account for only a minority of the deaths that occur in patients after acute coronary syndrome. Here, we investigated the use of three computationally generated cardiac biomarkers for risk stratification in this population: morphologic variability (MV), symbolic mismatch (SM), and heart rate motifs (HRM). We derived these biomarkers from time-series analyses of continuous electrocardiographic data collected from patients in the TIMI-DISPERSE2 clinical trial through machine learning and data mining methods designed to extract information that is difficult to visualize directly in these data. We evaluated these biomarkers in a blinded, prespecified, and fully automated study on more than 4500 patients in the MERLIN-TIMI36 (Metabolic Efficiency with Ranolazine for Less Ischemia in Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 36) clinical trial. Our results showed a strong association between all three computationally generated cardiac biomarkers and cardiovascular death in the MERLIN-TIMI36 trial over a 2-year period after acute coronary syndrome. Moreover, the information in each of these biomarkers was independent of the information in the others and independent of the information provided by existing clinical risk scores, electrocardiographic metrics, and echocardiography. The addition of MV, SM, and HRM to existing metrics significantly improved model discrimination, as well as the precision and recall of prediction rules based on left ventricular ejection fraction. These biomarkers can be extracted from data that are routinely captured from patients with acute coronary syndrome and will allow for more accurate risk stratification and potentially for better patient treatment.},

abstract = {We have studied the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection in mice that are unable to respond to type I or II interferons due to a targeted disruption of the STAT1 gene. STAT1-/- animals are 100-fold more sensitive to lethal infection with influenza A/WSN/33 virus than are their wild-type (WT) counterparts. Virus replicated only in the lungs of WT animals following intranasal (i.n.) virus inoculation, while STAT1-/- mice developed a fulminant systemic influenza virus infection following either i.n. or intraperitoneal inoculation. We investigated the mechanism underlying this altered virus tropism by comparing levels of virus replication in fibroblast cell lines and murine embryonic fibroblasts derived from WT mice, STAT-/- mice, and mice lacking gamma interferon (IFNgamma-/- mice) or the IFN-alpha receptor (IFNalphaR-/- mice). Influenza A/WSN/33 virus replicates to high titers in STAT1-/- or IFNalphaR-/- fibroblasts, while cells derived from WT or IFNgamma-/- animals are resistant to influenza virus infection. Immunofluorescence studies using WT fibroblast cell lines demonstrated that only a small subpopulation of WT cells can be infected and that in the few infected WT cells, virus replication is aborted at an early, nuclear phase. In all organs examined except the lung, influenza A WSN/33 virus infection is apparently prevented by an intact type I interferon response. Our results demonstrate that type I interferon plays an important role in determining the pathogenicity and tissue restriction of influenza A/WSN/33 virus in vivo and in vitro.},

abstract = {The pathogenicity of avian H5N1 influenza viruses to mammals has been evolving since the mid-1980s. Here, we demonstrate that H5N1 influenza viruses, isolated from apparently healthy domestic ducks in mainland China from 1999 through 2002, were becoming progressively more pathogenic for mammals, and we present a hypothesis explaining the mechanism of this evolutionary direction. Twenty-one viruses isolated from apparently healthy ducks in southern China from 1999 through 2002 were confirmed to be H5N1 subtype influenza A viruses. These isolates are antigenically similar to A/Goose/Guangdong/1/96 (H5N1) virus, which was the source of the 1997 Hong Kong "bird flu" hemagglutinin gene, and all are highly pathogenic in chickens. The viruses form four pathotypes on the basis of their replication and lethality in mice. There is a clear temporal pattern in the progressively increasing pathogenicity of these isolates in the mammalian model. Five of six H5N1 isolates tested replicated in inoculated ducks and were shed from trachea or cloaca, but none caused disease signs or death. Phylogenetic analysis of the full genome indicated that most of the viruses are reassortants containing the A/Goose/Guangdong/1/96-like hemagglutinin gene and the other genes from unknown Eurasian avian influenza viruses. This study is a characterization of the H5N1 avian influenza viruses recently circulating in ducks in mainland China. Our findings suggest that immediate action is needed to prevent the transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses from the apparently healthy ducks into chickens or mammalian hosts.},

abstract = {Background: The role of Clostridium difficile (CD) carriers in health care-associated CD transmission has been identified as an area needing research. We investigated the prevalence of, and risk factors for, asymptomatic CD colonization at hospital admission. Methods: Adults admitted to a tertiary care hospital in Minnesota on predetermined study days between March 1 and April 30, 2009, and without symptoms of C difficile infection, were eligible. The first stool sample after admission was requested from each consenting patient and tested for toxigenic CD using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that detects tcdC. Clinical data were obtained through interviews and chart reviews. Results: Of 320 participants, 31 (9.7{\%}) were positive for toxigenic CD. Using multivariate logistic regression, independent predictors of CD colonization were recent hospitalization (odds ratio [OR], 2.45; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-5.84), chronic dialysis (OR, 8.12; 95{\%} CI: 1.80-36.65), and corticosteroid use (OR, 3.09; 95{\%} CI: 1.24-7.73). Screening patients with risk factors (48{\%} participants) would identify 74{\%} (95{\%} CI: 55{\%}-88{\%}) of CD carriers. Conclusion: Asymptomatic CD colonization at hospital admission was detected in nearly 1 of 10 patients. The majority of colonized patients had one or more identifiable risk factors. These data could provide the basis for designing studies of targeted surveillance for C difficile.

Here we propose a novel gene network reconstruction algorithm, derived from classic Bayesian network methods, that utilizes naturally occurring genetic variations as a source of perturbations to elucidate the network. This algorithm incorporates relative transcript abundance and genotypic data from segregating populations by employing a generalized scoring function of maximum likelihood commonly used in Bayesian network reconstruction problems. The utility of this novel algorithm is demonstrated via application to liver gene expression data from a segregating mouse population. We demonstrate that the network derived from these data using our novel network reconstruction algorithm is able to capture causal associations between genes that result in increased predictive power, compared to more classically reconstructed networks derived from the same data.},

In particular, there are few tools to study the genetics and genomics of antibiotic resistance and how it impacts bacterial populations, ecology, and the clinic. We have initiated development of such tools in the form of the Comprehensive Antibiotic Research Database (CARD; http://arpcard.mcmaster.ca). The CARD integrates disparate molecular and sequence data, provides a unique organizing principle in the form of the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO), and can quickly identify putative antibiotic resistance genes in new unannotated genome sequences.

abstract = {Aim: Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) causes heavy financial burden on healthcare systems worldwide. As with all hospital-acquired infections, prolonged hospital stays are the main cost driver. Previous cost studies include only hospital billing data and compare the length of stay in contrast to uninfected patients. A survey of actual cost is still missing. Method: A retrospective analysis of data for patients with nosocomial CDAD was carried out over a 1-year period at the University hospital of Greifswald. Based on identification of CDAD-related treatment processes, cost of hygienic measures, antibiotics and laboratory as well as revenue losses due to bed closures and increased length of stay were calculated. Results: 19 patients were included in the analysis. On average, a CDAD-patient causes additional costs of 5262.96. Revenue losses due to extended length of stay take the highest proportion with 2555.59 per case, followed by the lost revenue due to bed closures during the isolation with 2413.08 per case. Overall, these opportunity costs accounted for 94.41 {\%} of total costs. On the contrary, costs for hygienic measures (253.98), drugs (22.88) and laboratory (17.44) are quite low. Conclusion: CDAD results in significant additional costs for the hospital. Our survey of real costs confirms previous study results. Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.},

abstract = {Endometriosis is a complex and multifactorial disease. Chromosomal imbalance screening in endometriotic tissue can be used to detect hot-spot regions in the search for a possible genetic marker for endometriosis. The objective of the present study was to detect chromosomal imbalances by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) in ectopic tissue samples from ovarian endometriomas and eutopic tissue from the same patients. We evaluated 10 ovarian endometriotic tissues and 10 eutopic endometrial tissues by metaphase CGH. CGH was prepared with normal and test DNA enzymatically digested, ligated to adaptors and amplified by PCR. A second PCR was performed for DNA labeling. Equal amounts of both normal and test-labeled DNA were hybridized in human normal metaphases. The Isis FISH Imaging System V 5.0 software was used for chromosome analysis. In both eutopic and ectopic groups, 4/10 samples presented chromosomal alterations, mainly chromosomal gains. CGH identified 11q12.3-q13.1, 17p11.1-p12, 17q25.3-qter, and 19p as critical regions. Genomic imbalances in 11q, 17p, 17q, and 19p were detected in normal eutopic and/or ectopic endometrium from women with ovarian endometriosis. These regions contain genes such as POLR2G, MXRA7 and UBA52 involved in biological processes that may lead to the establishment and maintenance of endometriotic implants. This genomic imbalance may affect genes in which dysregulation impacts both eutopic and ectopic endometrium.},

From our group's experience building a whole-cell model of Mycoplasma genitalium, we identified several significant challenges to building models of more complex cells. Here we review and discuss these challenges in seven areas: first, experimental interrogation; second, data curation; third, model building and integration; fourth, accelerated computation; fifth, analysis and visualization; sixth, model validation; and seventh, collaboration and community development. Surmounting these challenges will require the cooperation of an interdisciplinary group of researchers to create increasingly sophisticated whole-cell models and make data, models, and simulations more accessible to the wider community. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The use of inbred strains of mice to dissect the genetic complexity of common diseases offers a viable alternative to human studies, given the control over experimental parameters that can be exercised. Central to efforts to map susceptibility loci for common diseases in mice is a comprehensive map of DNA variation among the common inbred strains of mice. Here we present one of the most comprehensive high-density, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) maps of mice constructed to date. This map consists of 10,350 SNPs genotyped in 62 strains of inbred mice. We demonstrate the utility of these data via a novel integrative genomics approach to mapping susceptibility loci for complex traits. By integrating in silico quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping with progressive QTL mapping strategies in segregating mouse populations that leverage large-scale mapping of the genetic determinants of gene expression traits, we not only facilitate identification of candidate quantitative trait genes, but also protect against spurious associations that can arise in genetic association studies due to allelic association among unlinked markers. Application of this approach to our high-density SNP map and two previously described F2 crosses between strains C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J and between B6 ApoE(-/-) and C3H/HeJ ApoE(-/-) results in the identification of Insig2 as a strong candidate susceptibility gene for total plasma cholesterol levels.},

@article{Gill2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been long well known that genes do not act alone; rather groups of genes act in consort during a biological process. Consequently, the expression levels of genes are dependent on each other. Experimental techniques to detect such interacting pairs of genes have been in place for quite some time. With the advent of microarray technology, newer computational techniques to detect such interaction or association between gene expressions are being proposed which lead to an association network. While most microarray analyses look for genes that are differentially expressed, it is of potentially greater significance to identify how entire association network structures change between two or more biological settings, say normal versus diseased cell types. RESULTS: We provide a recipe for conducting a differential analysis of networks constructed from microarray data under two experimental settings. At the core of our approach lies a connectivity score that represents the strength of genetic association or interaction between two genes. We use this score to propose formal statistical tests for each of following queries: (i) whether the overall modular structures of the two networks are different, (ii) whether the connectivity of a particular set of "interesting genes" has changed between the two networks, and (iii) whether the connectivity of a given single gene has changed between the two networks. A number of examples of this score is provided. We carried out our method on two types of simulated data: Gaussian networks and networks based on differential equations. We show that, for appropriate choices of the connectivity scores and tuning parameters, our method works well on simulated data. We also analyze a real data set involving normal versus heavy mice and identify an interesting set of genes that may play key roles in obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Examining changes in network structure can provide valuable information about the underlying biochemical pathways. Differential network analysis with appropriate connectivity scores is a useful tool in exploring changes in network structures under different biological conditions. An R package of our tests can be downloaded from the supplementary website http://www.somnathdatta.org/Supp/DNA.},

abstract = {If H5N1 influenza viruses become transmissible among humans, vaccination will offer the most effective option to limit their spread. Two human vaccine candidates recently generated by reverse genetics are based on antigenically different hemagglutinin (HA) glycoproteins derived from the A/HK/213/03 (H5N1) and A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) viruses. Their HA1 amino acid sequences differ at 10 positions, one of which (N154) introduces a potential glycosylation site in A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1). To assess the impact of five amino acids in the putative antigenic sites on immunogenicity and immune protection, we generated a series of whole-virus vaccines that differed only in one or two HA amino acids. Sera from ferrets vaccinated with these inactivated preparations had high virus neutralization titers, but their hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers were usually low. Interestingly, a recombinant virus in which the HA amino acid S223 (characteristic of 2004 viruses) was converted to N223 (as in A/HK/213/03) resulted in higher HI titers. This observation indicates that specific HA residues, such as N223, increase the sensitivity of the HI assay by altering receptor specificity and/or antibody-antigen binding. Ferrets vaccinated with mutant vaccine viruses were protected against lethal challenge with wild-type A/Vietnam/1203/04 virus. Our results suggest that inclusion of the N223 residue in the HA glycoproteins of diagnostic reference viruses may facilitate the evaluation of vaccine efficacy in humans.},

The pathological and immunological response upon Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection have been reported over the last few years. However, the clinical profile and immune response upon CHIKV infection in children remain largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the clinical and immunological response, focusing on the cytokine/chemokine profile in a CHIKV-infected pediatric cohort from Sarawak, Malaysia. Unique immune mediators triggered upon CHIKV infection were identified through meta-analysis of the immune signatures between this pediatric group and cohorts from previous outbreaks. The data generated from this study revealed that a broad spectrum of cytokines/chemokines is up-regulated in a sub-group of virus-infected children stratified according to their viremic status during hospitalization. Furthermore, different immune mediator profiles (the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and growth and other factors) were observed between children and adults. This study gives an important insight to understand the immune response of CHIKV infection in children and would aid in the development of better prognostics and clinical management for children.},

abstract = {Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is the causative agent of an outbreak that began in La R{\'{e}}union in 2005 and remains a major public health concern in India, Southeast Asia, and southern Europe. CHIKV is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes and the associated disease is characterized by fever, myalgia, arthralgia, and rash. As viral load in infected patients declines before the appearance of neutralizing antibodies, we studied the role of type I interferon (IFN) in CHIKV pathogenesis. Based on human studies and mouse experimentation, we show that CHIKV does not directly stimulate type I IFN production in immune cells. Instead, infected nonhematopoietic cells sense viral RNA in a Cardif-dependent manner and participate in the control of infection through their production of type I IFNs. Although the Cardif signaling pathway contributes to the immune response, we also find evidence for a MyD88-dependent sensor that is critical for preventing viral dissemination. Moreover, we demonstrate that IFN-alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR) expression is required in the periphery but not on immune cells, as IFNAR(-/-)--{\textgreater}WT bone marrow chimeras are capable of clearing the infection, whereas WT--{\textgreater}IFNAR(-/-) chimeras succumb. This study defines an essential role for type I IFN, produced via cooperation between multiple host sensors and acting directly on nonhematopoietic cells, in the control of CHIKV.},

abstract = {We have previously obtained four transfectant influenza A viruses containing neuraminidase (NA) genes with mutated base pairs in the conserved double-stranded RNA region of the viral promoter by using a ribonucleoprotein transfection system. Two mutant viruses (D2 and D1/2) which share a C-G--{\textgreater}A-U mutation at positions 11 and 12 of the 3' and 5' ends, respectively, of the NA gene, showed an approximate 10-fold reduction of NA-specific mRNA and protein levels (Fodor et al., Journal of Virology 72, 6283-6290, 1998). These viruses have now allowed us to determine the effects of decreased NA levels on virus pathogenicity. Both D2 and D1/2 viruses were highly attenuated in mice, and their replication in mouse lungs was highly compromised as compared with wild-type influenza A/WSN/33 virus. The results highlight the importance of the level of NA activity in the biological cycle and virulence of influenza viruses. Importantly, mice immunized by a single intranasal administration of 10(3) infectious units of D2 or D1/2 viruses were protected against challenge with a lethal dose of wild-type influenza virus. Attenuation of influenza viruses by mutations resulting in the decreased expression of a viral protein represents a novel strategy which could be considered for the generation of live attenuated influenza virus vaccines.},

abstract = {Control of highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza viruses is a major public-health concern. Antiviral drugs could be the only option early in the pandemic.METHODS. BALB/c mice were given oseltamivir (0.1, 1, or 10 mg/kg/day) twice daily by oral gavage; the first dose was given 4 h before inoculation with H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/04 (VN1203/04) virus. Five- and 8-day regimens were evaluated.RESULTS. Oseltamivir produced a dose-dependent antiviral effect against VN1203/04 in vivo (P{\textless}.01). The 5-day regimen at 10 mg/kg/day protected 50{\%} of mice; deaths in this treatment group were delayed and indicated the replication of residual virus after the completion of treatment. Eight-day regimens improved oseltamivir efficacy, and dosages of 1 and 10 mg/kg/day significantly reduced virus titers in organs and provided 60{\%} and 80{\%} survival rates, respectively (P{\textless}.05). Overall, the efficacy of the 5- and 8-day regimens differed significantly (death hazard ratio, 2.658; P{\textless}.01). The new H5N1 antigenic variant VN1203/04 was more pathogenic in mice than was A/HK/156/97 virus, and a prolonged and higher-dose oseltamivir regimen may be required for the most beneficial antiviral effect.CONCLUSIONS. Oseltamivir prophylaxis is efficacious against lethal challenge with VN1203/04 virus in mice. Viral virulence may affect the antiviral treatment schedule.},

By combining experimental evolution and genome sequencing of 63 laboratory-evolved lines, we charted a map of cross-resistance interactions between antibiotics in Escherichia coli, and explored the driving evolutionary principles. Here, we show that (1) convergent molecular evolution is prevalent across antibiotic treatments, (2) resistance conferring mutations simultaneously enhance sensitivity to many other drugs and (3) 27{\%} of the accumulated mutations generate proteins with compromised activities, suggesting that antibiotic adaptation can partly be achieved without gain of novel function. By using knowledge on antibiotic properties, we examined the determinants of cross-resistance and identified chemogenomic profile similarity between antibiotics as the strongest predictor. In contrast, cross-resistance between two antibiotics is independent of whether they show synergistic effects in combination. These results have important implications on the development of novel antimicrobial strategies.},

abstract = {We describe a model-based method for using multilocus sequence data to infer the clonal relationships of bacteria and the chromosomal position of homologous recombination events that disrupt a clonal pattern of inheritance. The key assumption of our model is that recombination events introduce a constant rate of substitutions to a contiguous region of sequence. The method is applicable both to multilocus sequence typing (MLST) data from a few loci and to alignments of multiple bacterial genomes. It can be used to decide whether a subset of isolates share common ancestry, to estimate the age of the common ancestor, and hence to address a variety of epidemiological and ecological questions that hinge on the pattern of bacterial spread. It should also be useful in associating particular genetic events with the changes in phenotype that they cause. We show that the model outperforms existing methods of subdividing recombinogenic bacteria using MLST data and provide examples from Salmonella and Bacillus.

Thirty-five toxigenic C. difficile isolates from 16 patients with 19 recurrent CDI episodes with median time of 53.5 days (range, 13–362) between episodes were whole genome sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform. In 84{\%} (16) of recurrences, the cause of recurrence was relapse with prior strain of C. difficile. In 16{\%} (3) of recurrent episodes, reinfection with a new strain of C. difficile was the cause. In conclusion, the majority of CDI recurrences at our institution were due to infection with the same strain rather than infection with a new strain.},

@article{Walker2013a,
abstract = {Background: Tuberculosis incidence in the UK has risen in the past decade. Disease control depends on epidemiological data, which can be difficult to obtain. Whole-genome sequencing can detect microevolution within Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. We aimed to estimate the genetic diversity of related M tuberculosis strains in the UK Midlands and to investigate how this measurement might be used to investigate community outbreaks. Methods: In a retrospective observational study, we used Illumina technology to sequence M tuberculosis genomes from an archive of frozen cultures. We characterised isolates into four groups: cross-sectional, longitudinal, household, and community. We measured pairwise nucleotide differences within hosts and between hosts in household outbreaks and estimated the rate of change in DNA sequences. We used the findings to interpret network diagrams constructed from 11 community clusters derived from mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit-variable-number tandem-repeat data. Findings: We sequenced 390 separate isolates from 254 patients, including representatives from all five major lineages of M tuberculosis. The estimated rate of change in DNA sequences was 0{\textperiodcentered}5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per genome per year (95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}3-0{\textperiodcentered}7) in longitudinal isolates from 30 individuals and 25 families. Divergence is rarely higher than five SNPs in 3 years. 109 (96{\%}) of 114 paired isolates from individuals and households differed by five or fewer SNPs. More than five SNPs separated isolates from none of 69 epidemiologically linked patients, two (15{\%}) of 13 possibly linked patients, and 13 (17{\%}) of 75 epidemiologically unlinked patients (three-way comparison exact p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Genetic trees and clinical and epidemiological data suggest that super-spreaders were present in two community clusters. Interpretation: Whole-genome sequencing can delineate outbreaks of tuberculosis and allows inference about direction of transmission between cases. The technique could identify super-spreaders and predict the existence of undiagnosed cases, potentially leading to early treatment of infectious patients and their contacts.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that a checklist enhanced by the electronic medical record and a unit-wide dashboard would improve compliance with an evidence-based, pediatric-specific catheter care bundle and decrease central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI).

METHODS: We performed a cohort study with historical controls that included all patients with a central venous catheter in a 24-bed PICU in an academic children's hospital. Postintervention CLABSI rates, compliance with bundle elements, and staff perceptions of communication were evaluated and compared with preintervention data.

RESULTS: CLABSI rates decreased from 2.6 CLABSIs per 1000 line-days before intervention to 0.7 CLABSIs per 1000 line-days after intervention. Analysis of specific bundle elements demonstrated increased daily documentation of line necessity from 30{\%} to 73{\%} (P {\textless} .001), increased compliance with dressing changes from 87{\%} to 90{\%} (P = .003), increased compliance with cap changes from 87{\%} to 93{\%} (P {\textless} .001), increased compliance with port needle changes from 69{\%} to 95{\%} (P {\textless} .001), but decreased compliance with insertion bundle documentation from 67{\%} to 62{\%} (P = .001). Changes in the care plan were made during review of the electronic medical record checklist on 39{\%} of patient rounds episodes.

CONCLUSIONS: Use of an electronic medical record-enhanced CLABSI prevention checklist coupled with a unit-wide real-time display of adherence was associated with increased compliance with evidence-based catheter care and sustained decrease in CLABSI rates. These data underscore the potential for computerized interventions to promote compliance with proven best practices and prevent patient harm.},

Combining of the sequence data with detailed metadata on patient admission and movement confirmed that the outbreak was due to the transmission of a single clonal variant of ST228, rather than repeated introductions of this clone into the hospital. We note that this clone is significantly more frequently recovered from groin and rectal swabs than other clones ( P {\textless} 0.0001) and is also significantly more transmissible between roommates ( P {\textless} 0.01). Unrecognized MRSA carriers, together with movements of patients within the hospital, also seem to have played a major role. These atypical colonization and transmission dynamics can help explain how the outbreak was maintained over the long term. This “stealthy” asymptomatic colonization of the gut, combined with heightened transmissibility (potentially reflecting a role for environmental reservoirs), means the dynamics of this outbreak share some properties with enteric pathogens such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci or Clostridium difficile .},

abstract = {The adaptive immune response selectively expands B- and T-cell clones following antigen recognition by B- and T-cell receptors (BCR and TCR), respectively. Next-generation sequencing is a powerful tool for dissecting the BCR and TCR populations at high resolution, but robust computational analyses are required to interpret such sequencing. Here, we develop a novel computational approach for BCR repertoire analysis using established next-generation sequencing methods coupled with network construction and population analysis. BCR sequences organize into networks based on sequence diversity, with differences in network connectivity clearly distinguishing between diverse repertoires of healthy individuals and clonally expanded repertoires from individuals with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other clonal blood disorders. Network population measures defined by the Gini Index and cluster sizes quantify the BCR clonality status and are robust to sampling and sequencing depths. BCR network analysis therefore allows the direct and quantifiable comparison of BCR repertoires between samples and intra-individual population changes between temporal or spatially separated samples and over the course of therapy.},

abstract = {Only a minority of those exposed to human papillomavirus (HPV) develop HPV-related cervical and oropharyngeal cancer. Because host immunity affects infection and progression to cancer, we tested the hypothesis that genetic variation in immune-related genes is a determinant of susceptibility to oropharyngeal cancer and other HPV-associated cancers by performing a multitier integrative computational analysis with oropharyngeal cancer data from a head and neck cancer genome-wide association study (GWAS). Independent analyses, including single-gene, gene-interconnectivity, protein-protein interaction, gene expression, and pathway analysis, identified immune genes and pathways significantly associated with oropharyngeal cancer. TGFbetaR1, which intersected all tiers of analysis and thus selected for validation, replicated significantly in the head and neck cancer GWAS limited to HPV-seropositive cases and an independent cervical cancer GWAS. The TGFbetaR1 containing p38-MAPK pathway was significantly associated with oropharyngeal cancer and cervical cancer, and TGFbetaR1 was overexpressed in oropharyngeal cancer, cervical cancer, and HPV(+) head and neck cancer tumors. These concordant analyses implicate TGFbetaR1 signaling as a process dysregulated across HPV-related cancers. This study demonstrates that genetic variation in immune-related genes is associated with susceptibility to oropharyngeal cancer and implicates TGFbetaR1/TGFbeta signaling in the development of both oropharyngeal cancer and cervical cancer. Better understanding of the immunogenetic basis of susceptibility to HPV-associated cancers may provide insight into host/virus interactions and immune processes dysregulated in the minority of HPV-exposed individuals who progress to cancer.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel application building interface for computational biology research, called VizBuilder, by leveraging a recent query language called BioFlow for life sciences databases. Using VizBuilder, it is now possible to develop ad hoc complex computational biology applications at throw away costs. The underlying query language supports data integration and workflow construction almost transparently and fully automatically, using a best effort approach. Users express their application by drawing it with VizBuilder icons and connecting them in a meaningful way. Completed applications are compiled and translated as BioFlow queries for execution by the data management system LifeDB, for which VizBuilder serves as a front end. We discuss VizBuilder features and functionalities in the context of a real life application after we briefly introduce BioFlow. The architecture and design principles of VizBuilder are also discussed. Finally, we outline future extensions of VizBuilder. To our knowledge, VizBuilder is a unique system that allows visually designing computational biology pipelines involving distributed and heterogeneous resources in an ad hoc manner.},

abstract = {On 29 March 2013, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first reported case of human infection with an avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. The recent human infections with H7N9 virus, totalling over 130 cases with 39 fatalities to date, have been characterized by severe pulmonary disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This is concerning because H7 viruses have typically been associated with ocular disease in humans, rather than severe respiratory disease. This recent outbreak underscores the need to better understand the pathogenesis and transmission of these viruses in mammals. Here we assess the ability of A/Anhui/1/2013 and A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) viruses, isolated from fatal human cases, to cause disease in mice and ferrets and to transmit to naive animals. Both H7N9 viruses replicated to higher titre in human airway epithelial cells and in the respiratory tract of ferrets compared to a seasonal H3N2 virus. Moreover, the H7N9 viruses showed greater infectivity and lethality in mice compared to genetically related H7N9 and H9N2 viruses. The H7N9 viruses were readily transmitted to naive ferrets through direct contact but, unlike the seasonal H3N2 virus, did not transmit readily by respiratory droplets. The lack of efficient respiratory droplet transmission was corroborated by low receptor-binding specificity for human-like $\alpha$2,6-linked sialosides. Our results indicate that H7N9 viruses have the capacity for efficient replication in mammals and human airway cells and highlight the need for continued public health surveillance of this emerging virus.},

Here, we present a systematic strategy to elucidate the dynamic interactions between H1N1 influenza and its human host. A combination of yeast two-hybrid analysis and genome-wide expression profiling implicated hundreds of human factors in mediating viral-host interactions. These factors were then examined functionally through depletion analyses in primary lung cells. The resulting data point to potential roles for some unanticipated host and viral proteins in viral infection and the host response, including a network of RNA-binding proteins, components of WNT signaling, and viral polymerase subunits. This multilayered approach provides a comprehensive and unbiased physical and regulatory model of influenza-host interactions and demonstrates a general strategy for uncovering complex host-pathogen relationships.},

abstract = {Gene co-expression networks are increasingly used to explore the system-level functionality of genes. The network construction is conceptually straightforward: nodes represent genes and nodes are connected if the corresponding genes are significantly co-expressed across appropriately chosen tissue samples. In reality, it is tricky to define the connections between the nodes in such networks. An important question is whether it is biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary information (connected=1, unconnected=0). We describe a general framework for ;soft' thresholding that assigns a connection weight to each gene pair. This leads us to define the notion of a weighted gene co-expression network. For soft thresholding we propose several adjacency functions that convert the co-expression measure to a connection weight. For determining the parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology criterion). We generalize the following important network concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence that they can be important for predicting the biological significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the ;weighted' topological overlap measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive modules than its ;unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard thresholding. We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set.},

Rather than hide the underlying scenegraph within a toolkit-specific abstraction, D3 enables direct inspection and manipulation of a native representation: the standard document object model (DOM). With D3, designers selectively bind input data to arbitrary document elements, applying dynamic transforms to both generate and modify content. We show how representational transparency improves expressiveness and better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches, while offering comparable notational efficiency and retaining powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative development. Additionally, we demonstrate how D3 transforms naturally enable animation and interaction with dramatic performance improvements over intermediate representations.},

The basis for chikungunya disease and the tropism of CHIKV remain unknown. Here, we describe the replication characteristics of recent clinical CHIKV strains. Human epithelial and endothelial cells, primary fibroblasts and, to a lesser extent, monocyte-derived macrophages, were susceptible to infection and allowed viral production. In contrast, CHIKV did not replicate in lymphoid and monocytoid cell lines, primary lymphocytes and monocytes, or monocyte-derived dendritic cells. CHIKV replication was cytopathic and associated with an induction of apoptosis in infected cells. Chloroquine, bafilomycin-A1, and short hairpin RNAs against dynamin-2 inhibited viral production, indicating that viral entry occurs through pH-dependent endocytosis. CHIKV was highly sensitive to the antiviral activity of type I and II interferons. These results provide a general insight into the interaction between CHIKV and its mammalian host.},

One of the main goals of SNP research is to understand the genetics of the human phenotype variation and especially the genetic basis of human complex diseases. Non-synonymous coding SNPs (nsSNPs) comprise a group of SNPs that, together with SNPs in regulatory regions, are believed to have the highest impact on phenotype. Here we present a World Wide Web server to predict the effect of an nsSNP on protein structure and function. The prediction method enabled analysis of the publicly available SNP database HGVbase, which gave rise to a dataset of nsSNPs with predicted functionality. The dataset was further used to compare the effect of various structural and functional characteristics of amino acid substitutions responsible for phenotypic display of nsSNPs. We also studied the dependence of selective pressure on the structural and functional properties of proteins. We found that in our dataset the selection pressure against deleterious SNPs depends on the molecular function of the protein, although it is insensitive to several other protein features considered. The strongest selective pressure was detected for proteins involved in transcription regulation.},

The brief find[sic] high levels of meaningful use for EHR items and substantial information-sharing with other organizations or health authorities, although less information is shared with patients. Insights that may prove useful to the United States include providing economic incentives to encourage adoption and designating an organization to take responsibility for standardization and interoperability.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

@article{Ummat2014,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Resolving tandemly repeated genomic sequences is a necessary step in improving our understanding of the human genome. Short tandem repeats, or microsatellites, are often used as molecular markers in genetics, and clinically, variation in microsatellites can lead to genetic disorders like Huntingon's diseases. Accurately resolving repeats, and in particular tandem repeats (TRs), remains a challenging task in genome alignment, assembly, and variation calling. Though tools have been developed for detecting microsatellites in short-read sequencing data, these are limited in the size and types of events they can resolve. Single-molecule sequencing technologies may potentially resolve a broader spectrum of tandem repeats given their increased length, but require new approaches given their significantly higher raw error-profiles. However, due to inherent error profiles of the single molecule technologies, these reads presents a unique challenge in terms of accurately identifying and estimating the tandem repeats. RESULTS: Here we present PacmonSTR a reference-based probabilistic approach to identify the TR region and estimate the number of these TR elements in long DNA reads. We present a multi-step approach that requires as input, a reference region and the reference tandem repeat element. Initially, the TR region is identified from the long DNA reads via a 3-stage modified smith-waterman approach and then, expected number of TR elements are calculated using a pair-Hidden Markov Models (pairHMM) based method. Finally, TR based genotype selection (or clustering: homozygous/heterozygous) is performed with gaussian-mixture-models (GMMs), utilizing the Akaike information criteria (AIC), and coverage expectations.

abstract = {Measurements of the thermal desorption of methyl bromide (MeBr) from bare and RS-functionalized GaAs(110), where R = CH3 and CH3CH2, reveal marked systematic changes in molecule-surface interactions. As the thickness of the organic spacer layer is increased, the electrostatic MeBr-GaAs(110) interaction decreases, lowering the activation energy for desorption, Ed, as well as decreasing the critical coverage required for nucleation of bulklike MeBr. On the CH3CH2S-functionalized surface, Ed is lowered to a value roughly equal to that for desorption from three-dimensional (3-D) clusters; because the kinetics of desorption of isolated molecules differs from that for desorption from clusters, desorption of isolated molecules from the organic surface occurs at a lower temperature than desorption from the clusters. Thus, the "monolayer" desorption wave occurs at a lower temperature than the "multilayer" desorption wave. These results illustrate the role that organic chain length in nanometer-scale thin films can play in alteration of the delicate balance of interfacial interactions.},

abstract = {Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a nosocomial bacterial pathogen intrinsically resistant to several antibiotics. The mechanisms involved in this intrinsic multiresistance phenotype are poorly understood. A library of chromosomal DNA from a spontaneous multidrug-resistant S. maltophilia D457R mutant (A. Alonso and J. L. Martinez, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 41:1140-1142, 1997) was screened for complementation of erythromycin susceptibility on an antibiotic-hypersusceptible Escherichia coli DeltaacrAB strain. Cloning and further analysis revealed that a 6-kbp region constituting a transcriptional unit was capable of complementing the antibiotic-susceptible phenotype of an E. coli DeltaacrAB strain. We identified three open reading frames, smeD, smeE and smeF, which code for members of the membrane fusion protein, resistance nodulation division, and outer membrane factor families, respectively. Drug susceptibility assays indicated that the SmeDEF system cloned in E. coli mediates resistance to a wide range of antibiotics. Ethidium bromide and norfloxacin accumulation experiments in the presence and in the absence of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone showed that this system constitutes a drug efflux pump dependent on the membrane proton motive force. The presence of high levels of smeDEF mRNA in the multiresistant D457R mutant was consistent with the high levels of SmeF (formerly Omp54) observed in the same strain. In contrast, transcription levels of smeDEF in the D457 strain were tiny, which correlates with the low levels of SmeF observed for this strain. Also, for both the D457 and D457R strains, we observed growth phase-dependent regulation in which the highest level of transcription corresponded to early exponential phase, with transcription decreasing throughout the growth curve to undetectable levels at 24 h.},

Reversal distance between permutations {\&}pgr; and {\&}sgr;is the minimum number of reversals to transform {\&}pgr; into {\&}Agr;. Analysis of genome rearrangements in molecular biology started in the late 1930's, when Dobzhansky  and Sturtevant published a milestone paper presenting a rearrangement scenario with 17 inversions between the species of Drosophilia. Analysis of genomes evolving by inversions leads to a combinatorial problem of sorting by reversals studied in detail recently. We study sorting of signed permutations by reversals, a problem that adequately models rearrangements in a small genomes like chloroplast or mitochondrial DNA. The previously suggested approximation algorithms for sorting signed permutations by reversals compute the reversal distance between permutations with an astonishing accuracy for both simulated and biological data. We prove a duality theorem explaining this intriguing performance and show that there exists a  “hidden” parameter that allows one to compute the reversal distance between signed permutations in polynomial time.},

abstract = {It is estimated that in 2009, more than 3 million kilograms of antimicrobials were administered to human patients in the United States. While the life-saving benefits of antimicrobials are indisputable, the consequences of use and misuse must also be considered. Major concerns related to the use of antimicrobials are increasing resistance, higher incidence of Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection (CDI) and increased healthcare costs (including costs related to adverse events associated with antimicrobial use). While much of the discussion focuses on overuse, there is also evidence of adverse outcomes associated with inadequate antimicrobial therapy. Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are a focused effort by a health care system, a hospital, or a portion of a hospital (e.g., an intensive care unit) to optimize the use of antimicrobial agents. The goals of an ASP are to improve patient outcomes, reduce adverse consequences, reduce or prevent an increase in antimicrobial resistance, and deliver cost-effective therapy. The emphasis is on appropriate selection, dosing, route, and duration of antimicrobial therapy. The purpose of this review is to synthesize the evidence about the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programs implemented in hospital settings. We focus on ASPs including one or more of the following components: prospective audit and feedback, formulary restriction, pre-authorization of prescriptions, guidelines for prescribing and/or modifying therapy, computerized decision support, or laboratory testing. The topic was nominated by Matthew Goetz, MD, Chief, Infectious Diseases, VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, on behalf of the VA Antimicrobial Stewardship Task Force, and is intended to provide a summary of the evidence on inpatient antimicrobial stewardship programs to guide clinical practice and policy within the Veterans Healthcare System.},

abstract = {RNA virus phenotypic changes often result from multiple alternative molecular mechanisms, where each mechanism involves changes to a small number of key residues. Accordingly, we propose to learn genotype-phenotype functions, using Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) as the assumed functional form. In this study we develop DNF learning algorithms that attempt to construct predictors as Boolean combinations of covariates. We demonstrate the learning algorithm's consistency and efficiency on simulated sequences, and establish their biological relevance using a variety of real RNA virus datasets representing different viral phenotypes, including drug resistance, antigenicity, and pathogenicity. We compare our algorithms with previously published machine learning algorithms in terms of prediction quality: leave-one-out performance shows superior accuracy to other machine learning algorithms on the HIV drug resistance dataset and the UCIs promoter gene dataset. The algorithms are powerful in inferring the genotype-phenotype mapping from a moderate number of labeled sequences, as are typically produced in mutagenesis experiments. They can also greedily learn DNFs from large datasets. The Java implementation of our algorithms will be made publicly available.},

abstract = {Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is becoming available as a routine tool for clinical microbiology. If applied directly on clinical samples, this could further reduce diagnostic times and thereby improve control and treatment. A major bottleneck is the availability of fast and reliable bioinformatic tools. This study was conducted to evaluate the applicability of WGS directly on clinical samples and to develop easy-to-use bioinformatic tools for the analysis of sequencing data. Thirty-five random urine samples from patients with suspected urinary tract infections were examined using conventional microbiology, WGS of isolated bacteria, and direct sequencing on pellets from the urine samples. A rapid method for analyzing the sequence data was developed. Bacteria were cultivated from 19 samples but in pure cultures from only 17 samples. WGS improved the identification of the cultivated bacteria, and almost complete agreement was observed between phenotypic and predicted antimicrobial susceptibilities. Complete agreement was observed between species identification, multilocus sequence typing, and phylogenetic relationships for Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis isolates when the results of WGS of cultured isolates and urine samples were directly compared. Sequencing directly from the urine enabled bacterial identification in polymicrobial samples. Additional putative pathogenic strains were observed in some culture-negative samples. WGS directly on clinical samples can provide clinically relevant information and drastically reduce diagnostic times. This may prove very useful, but the need for data analysis is still a hurdle to clinical implementation. To overcome this problem, a publicly available bioinformatic tool was developed in this study.},

abstract = {Background Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) possibly extends hospital length of stay (LOS); however, the current evidence does not account for the time-dependent bias, ie, when infection is incorrectly analyzed as a baseline covariate. The aim of this study was to determine whether CDI increases LOS after managing this bias. Methods We examined the estimated extra LOS because of CDI using a multistate model. Data from all persons hospitalized {\textgreater}48 hours over 4 years in a tertiary hospital in Australia were analyzed. Persons with health care-associated CDIs were identified. Cox proportional hazards models were applied together with multistate modeling. Results One hundred fifty-eight of 58,942 admissions examined had CDI. The mean extra LOS because of infection was 0.9 days (95{\%} confidence interval: -1.8 to 3.6 days, P =.51) when a multistate model was applied. The hazard of discharge was lower in persons who had CDI (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.42; P {\textless}.001) when a Cox proportional hazard model was applied. Conclusion This study is the first to use multistate models to determine the extra LOS because of CDI. Results suggest CDI does not significantly contribute to hospital LOS, contradicting findings published elsewhere. Conversely, when methods prone to result in time-dependent bias were applied to the data, the hazard of discharge significantly increased. These findings contribute to discussion on methods used to evaluate LOS and health care-associated infections.},

abstract = {Summary$\backslash$n          There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Gene amplification is believed to play an important role in antibiotic resistance but has been rarely documented in clinical settings because of its unstable nature. We report a rise in MICs from 0.5 to 16 $\mu$g/ml in successive Acinetobacter baumannii isolated over 4 days from a patient being treated with tobramycin for an infection by multidrug-resistant A. baumannii, resulting in therapeutic failure. Isolates were characterized by whole-genome sequencing, real-time and reverse transcriptase PCR, and growth assays to determine the mechanism of tobramycin resistance and its fitness cost. Tobramycin resistance was associated with two amplification events of different chromosomal fragments containing the aphA1 aminoglycoside resistance gene part of transposon Tn6020. The first amplification event involved low amplification (6 to 10 copies) of a large DNA fragment that was unstable and conferred tobramycin MICs of ≤8 $\mu$g/ml. The second event involved moderate (10 to 30 copies) or high (40 to 110 copies) amplification of Tn6020. High copy numbers were associated with tobramycin MICs of 16 $\mu$g/ml, impaired fitness, and genetic instability, whereas lower copy numbers resulted in tobramycin MICs of ≤8 $\mu$g/ml and no fitness cost and were stably maintained in vitro. Exposure in vitro to tobramycin of the initial susceptible isolate and of the A. baumannii AB0057 reference strain led to similar aphA1 amplifications and elevated tobramycin MICs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of in vivo development of antibiotic resistance secondary to gene amplifications resulting in therapy failure. IMPORTANCE A combination of whole-genome sequencing and mapping were used to detect an antibiotic resistance mechanism, gene amplification, which has been presumed for a long time to be of major importance but has rarely been reported in clinical settings because of its unstable nature. Two gene amplification events in a patient with an Acinetobacter baumannii infection treated with tobramycin were identified. One gene amplification event led to high levels of resistance and was rapidly reversible, while the second event led to low and more stable resistance since it incurred low fitness cost on the host. Gene amplification, with an associated rise in tobramycin MICs, could be readily reproduced in vitro from initially susceptible strains exposed to increasing concentrations of tobramycin, suggesting that gene amplification in A. baumannii may be a more common mechanism than currently believed. This report underscores the importance of rapid molecular techniques for surveillance of drug resistance.},

abstract = {The Strategic Health IT Advanced Research Projects (SHARP) Program, established by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology in 2010 supports research findings that remove barriers for increased adoption of health IT. The improvements envisioned by the SHARP Area 4 Consortium (SHARPn) will enable the use of the electronic health record (EHR) for secondary purposes, such as care process and outcomes improvement, biomedical research and epidemiologic monitoring of the nation's health. One of the primary informatics problem areas in this endeavor is the standardization of disparate health data from the nation's many health care organizations and providers. The SHARPn team is developing open source services and components to support the ubiquitous exchange, sharing and reuse or 'liquidity' of operational clinical data stored in electronic health records. One year into the design and development of the SHARPn framework, we demonstrated end to end data flow and a prototype SHARPn platform, using thousands of patient electronic records sourced from two large healthcare organizations: Mayo Clinic and Intermountain Healthcare. The platform was deployed to (1) receive source EHR data in several formats, (2) generate structured data from EHR narrative text, and (3) normalize the EHR data using common detailed clinical models and Consolidated Health Informatics standard terminologies, which were (4) accessed by a phenotyping service using normalized data specifications. The architecture of this prototype SHARPn platform is presented. The EHR data throughput demonstration showed success in normalizing native EHR data, both structured and narrative, from two independent organizations and EHR systems. Based on the demonstration, observed challenges for standardization of EHR data for interoperable secondary use are discussed. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The gene regulatory network (GRN) reveals the regulatory relationships among genes and can provide a systematic understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying biological processes. The importance of computer simulations in understanding cellular processes is now widely accepted; a variety of algorithms have been developed to study these biological networks. The goal of this study is to provide a comprehensive evaluation and a practical guide to aid in choosing statistical methods for constructing large scale GRNs. Using both simulation studies and a real application in E. coli data, we compare different methods in terms of sensitivity and specificity in identifying the true connections and the hub genes, the ease of use, and computational speed. Our results show that these algorithms performed reasonably well, and each method has its own advantages: (1) GeneNet, WGCNA (Weighted Correlation Network Analysis), and ARACNE (Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks) performed well in constructing the global network structure; (2) GeneNet and SPACE (Sparse PArtial Correlation Estimation) performed well in identifying a few connections with high specificity.},

abstract = {In a European BIOMED-2 collaborative study, multiplex PCR assays have successfully been developed and standardized for the detection of clonally rearranged immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes and the chromosome aberrations t(11;14) and t(14;18). This has resulted in 107 different primers in only 18 multiplex PCR tubes: three VH-JH, two DH-JH, two Ig kappa (IGK), one Ig lambda (IGL), three TCR beta (TCRB), two TCR gamma (TCRG), one TCR delta (TCRD), three BCL1-Ig heavy chain (IGH), and one BCL2-IGH. The PCR products of Ig/TCR genes can be analyzed for clonality assessment by heteroduplex analysis or GeneScanning. The detection rate of clonal rearrangements using the BIOMED-2 primer sets is unprecedentedly high. This is mainly based on the complementarity of the various BIOMED-2 tubes. In particular, combined application of IGH (VH-JH and DH-JH) and IGK tubes can detect virtually all clonal B-cell proliferations, even in B-cell malignancies with high levels of somatic mutations. The contribution of IGL gene rearrangements seems limited. Combined usage of the TCRB and TCRG tubes detects virtually all clonal T-cell populations, whereas the TCRD tube has added value in case of TCRgammadelta(+) T-cell proliferations. The BIOMED-2 multiplex tubes can now be used for diagnostic clonality studies as well as for the identification of PCR targets suitable for the detection of minimal residual disease.},

This chapter surveys recent developments in the reconstruction of phylogenies from gene order and content, focusing on their performance under various stochastic models of evolution.

abstract = {As genomes evolve, they undergo large-scale evolutionary processes that present a challenge to sequence comparison not posed by short sequences. Recombination causes frequent genome rearrangements, horizontal transfer introduces new sequences into bacterial chromosomes, and deletions remove segments of the genome. Consequently, each genome is a mosaic of unique lineage-specific segments, regions shared with a subset of other genomes and segments conserved among all the genomes under consideration. Furthermore, the linear order of these segments may be shuffled among genomes. We present methods for identification and alignment of conserved genomic DNA in the presence of rearrangements and horizontal transfer. Our methods have been implemented in a software package called Mauve. Mauve has been applied to align nine enterobacterial genomes and to determine global rearrangement structure in three mammalian genomes. We have evaluated the quality of Mauve alignments and drawn comparison to other methods through extensive simulations of genome evolution.},

abstract = {Avian influenza A viruses rarely infect humans; however, when human infection and subsequent human-to-human transmission occurs, worldwide outbreaks (pandemics) can result. The recent sporadic infections of humans in China with a previously unrecognized avian influenza A virus of the H7N9 subtype (A(H7N9)) have caused concern owing to the appreciable case fatality rate associated with these infections (more than 25{\%}), potential instances of human-to-human transmission, and the lack of pre-existing immunity among humans to viruses of this subtype. Here we characterize two early human A(H7N9) isolates, A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) and A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9); hereafter referred to as Anhui/1 and Shanghai/1, respectively. In mice, Anhui/1 and Shanghai/1 were more pathogenic than a control avian H7N9 virus (A/duck/Gunma/466/2011 (H7N9); Dk/GM466) and a representative pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus (A/California/4/2009 (H1N1pdm09); CA04). Anhui/1, Shanghai/1 and Dk/GM466 replicated well in the nasal turbinates of ferrets. In nonhuman primates, Anhui/1 and Dk/GM466 replicated efficiently in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, whereas the replicative ability of conventional human influenza viruses is typically restricted to the upper respiratory tract of infected primates. By contrast, Anhui/1 did not replicate well in miniature pigs after intranasal inoculation. Critically, Anhui/1 transmitted through respiratory droplets in one of three pairs of ferrets. Glycan arrays showed that Anhui/1, Shanghai/1 and A/Hangzhou/1/2013 (H7N9) (a third human A(H7N9) virus tested in this assay) bind to human virus-type receptors, a property that may be critical for virus transmissibility in ferrets. Anhui/1 was found to be less sensitive in mice to neuraminidase inhibitors than a pandemic H1N1 2009 virus, although both viruses were equally susceptible to an experimental antiviral polymerase inhibitor. The robust replicative ability in mice, ferrets and nonhuman primates and the limited transmissibility in ferrets of Anhui/1 suggest that A(H7N9) viruses have pandemic potential.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a growing problem in the community and hospital setting. Its incidence has been on the rise over the past two decades, and it is quickly becoming a major concern for the health care system. High rate of recurrence is one of the major hurdles in the successful treatment of C. difficile infection. There have been few studies that have looked at patterns of recurrence. The studies currently available have shown a number of risk factors associated with C. difficile recurrence (CDR); however, there is little consensus on the impact of most of the identified risk factors. METHODS Our study was a retrospective chart review of 198 patients diagnosed with CDI via Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) from February 2009 to Jun 2013. In our study, we decided to use a machine learning algorithm called the Random Forest (RF) to analyze all of the factors proposed to be associated with CDR. This model is capable of making predictions based on a large number of variables, and has outperformed numerous other models and statistical methods. RESULTS We came up with a model that was able to accurately predict the CDR with a sensitivity of 83.3{\%}, specificity of 63.1{\%}, and area under curve of 82.6{\%}. Like other similar studies that have used the RF model, we also had very impressive results. CONCLUSIONS We hope that in the future, machine learning algorithms, such as the RF, will see a wider application.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Environmental surfaces may contribute to transmission of nosocomial pathogens. Noninvasive portable clinical items potentially shared among patients (NPIs) are part of the patient's immediate surroundings and may pose a threat of pathogen transmission.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the body of literature describing the range of microorganisms found on NPIs and evaluate the evidence regarding the potential for cross-transmission of microorganisms between NPIs and hospitalized patients in non-outbreak conditions.

DESIGN: A comprehensive list of NPIs was developed, and a systematic review of these items combined with healthcare-associated infection related keywords was performed.

DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library.

REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist to identify and synthesize research reports published between January 1990 and July 2013 on studies regarding contamination of NPIs and association to infections in non-outbreak circumstances.

RESULTS: 1498 records were scanned for eligibility. Thirteen studies met inclusion criteria. Overall, rates of NPI contamination ranged from 23{\%} to 100{\%}. Normal skin or environmental flora were found on almost all positive cultures. Potential pathogens, e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, were present on up to 86{\%}, and Pseudomonas spp. and/or Enterobacteriaceae in 38{\%} of positive cultures. Multi-drug resistant organisms were isolated from up to 25{\%} of items. Three studies explored association between NPIs contamination and patient colonization and infection. One study reported 5 patients with healthcare-associated infections with pathogens found concurrently on NPIs, one found cross-transmission between patient skin bacteria and NPI contamination, and a third did not find any cross-transmission.

CONCLUSIONS: Potential pathogens and multiply resistant organisms present on NPIs in routine, non-outbreak conditions and in a variety of settings confirms the need to improve NPIs decontamination practices.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
An estimated 100 million people have symptomatic dengue infection every year. This is the first report of a phase 3 vaccine efficacy trial of a candidate dengue vaccine. We aimed to assess the efficacy of the CYD dengue vaccine against symptomatic, virologically confirmed dengue in children. 

METHODS
We did an observer-masked, randomised controlled, multicentre, phase 3 trial in five countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Between June 3, and Dec 1, 2011, healthy children aged 2–14 years were randomly assigned (2:1), by computer-generated permuted blocks of six with an interactive voice or web response system, to receive three injections of a recombinant, live, attenuated, tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV), or placebo, at months 0, 6, and 12. Randomisation was stratified by age and site. Participants were followed up until month 25. Trial staff responsible for the preparation and administration of injections were unmasked to group allocation, but were not included in the follow-up of the participants; allocation was concealed from the study sponsor, investigators, and parents and guardians. Our primary objective was to assess protective efficacy against symptomatic, virologically confirmed dengue, irrespective of disease severity or serotype, that took place more than 28 days after the third injection. The primary endpoint was for the lower bound of the 95{\%} CI of vaccine efficacy to be greater than 25{\%}. Analysis was by intention to treat and per procotol. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01373281. 

FINDINGS
We randomly assigned 10 275 children to receive either vaccine (n=6851) or placebo (n=3424), of whom 6710 (98{\%}) and 3350 (98{\%}), respectively, were included in the primary analysis. 250 cases of virologically confirmed dengue took place more than 28 days after the third injection (117 [47{\%}] in the vaccine group and 133 [53{\%}] in the control group). The primary endpoint was achieved with 56{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} (95{\%} CI 43{\textperiodcentered}8–66{\textperiodcentered}4) efficacy. We recorded 647 serious adverse events (402 [62{\%}] in the vaccine group and 245 [38{\%}] in the control group). 54 (1{\%}) children in the vaccine group and 33 (1{\%}) of those in the control group had serious adverse events that happened within 28 days of vaccination. Serious adverse events were consistent with medical disorders in this age group and were mainly infections and injuries. 

INTERPRETATION
Our findings show that dengue vaccine is efficacious when given as three injections at months 0, 6, and 12 to children aged 2–14 years in endemic areas in Asia, and has a good safety profile. Vaccination could reduce the incidence of symptomatic infection and hospital admission and has the potential to provide an important public health benefit.

abstract = {DNA modifications such as methylation and DNA damage can play critical regulatory roles in biological systems. Single molecule, real time (SMRT) sequencing technology generates DNA sequences as well as DNA polymerase kinetic information that can be used for the direct detection of DNA modifications. We demonstrate that local sequence context has a strong impact on DNA polymerase kinetics in the neighborhood of the incorporation site during the DNA synthesis reaction, allowing for the possibility of estimating the expected kinetic rate of the enzyme at the incorporation site using kinetic rate information collected from existing SMRT sequencing data (historical data) covering the same local sequence contexts of interest. We develop an Empirical Bayesian hierarchical model for incorporating historical data. Our results show that the model could greatly increase DNA modification detection accuracy, and reduce requirement of control data coverage. For some DNA modifications that have a strong signal, a control sample is not even needed by using historical data as alternative to control. Thus, sequencing costs can be greatly reduced by using the model. We implemented the model in a R package named seqPatch, which is available at https://github.com/zhixingfeng/seqPatch.},

abstract = {Integrative genomics and genetics approaches have proven to be a useful tool in elucidating the complex relationships often found in gene regulatory networks. More importantly, a number of studies have provided the necessary experimental evidence confirming the validity of the causal relationships inferred using such an approach. By integrating messenger RNA (mRNA) expression data with microRNA (miRNA) (i.e. small non-coding RNA with well-established regulatory roles in a myriad of biological processes) expression data, we show how integrative genomics approaches can be used to characterize the role played by approximately a third of registered mouse miRNAs within the context of a liver gene regulatory network. Our analysis reveals that the transcript abundances of miRNAs are subject to regulatory control by many more loci than previously observed for mRNA expression. Moreover, our results indicate that miRNAs exist as highly connected hub-nodes and function as key sensors within the transcriptional network. We also provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that miRNAs can act cooperatively or redundantly to regulate a given pathway and that miRNAs play a subtle role by dampening expression of their target gene through the use of feedback loops.},

abstract = {Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent arthropod-borne human virus, able to infect and replicate in human dendritic cells (DCs), inducing their activation and the production of proinflammatory cytokines. However, DENV can successfully evade the immune response in order to produce disease in humans. Several mechanisms of immune evasion have been suggested for DENV, most of them involving interference with type I interferon (IFN) signaling. We recently reported that DENV infection of human DCs does not induce type I IFN production by those infected DCs, impairing their ability to prime naive T cells toward Th1 immunity. In this article, we report that DENV also reduces the ability of DCs to produce type I IFN in response to several inducers, such as infection with other viruses or exposure to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, indicating that DENV antagonizes the type I IFN production pathway in human DCs. DENV-infected human DCs showed a reduced type I IFN response to Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Sendai virus (SeV), and Semliki Forest virus (SFV) infection and to the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C). This inhibitory effect is DENV dose dependent, requires DENV replication, and takes place in DENV-infected DCs as early as 2 h after infection. Expressing individual proteins of DENV in the presence of an IFN-alpha/beta production inducer reveals that a catalytically active viral protease complex is required to reduce type I IFN production significantly. These results provide a new mechanism by which DENV evades the immune system in humans.},

abstract = {Colistin is a key drug for the treatment of infections caused by extensively drug-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae producing carbapenemases. However, the emergence of colistin resistance is being increasingly reported, especially among Klebsiella pneumoniae strains producing KPC-type carbapenemases (KPC-KP). In this work, we investigated colistin-susceptible (KPB-1) and colistin-resistant (KPB-2) sequential isolates obtained from a patient with a KPC-KP infection before and after low-dosage colistin treatment, respectively. By using a next-generation sequencing approach and comparative genomic analysis of the two isolates, we detected in KPB-2 a nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution in the gene encoding the PmrB sensor kinase, resulting in a leucine-to-arginine substitution at amino acid position 82. Compared with KPB-1, KPB-2 exhibited upregulated transcription of pmrA and of pmrK, which is part of the pmrHFIJKLM operon responsible for modification of the colistin lipopolysaccharide target. Complementation with wild-type pmrB in KPB-2 restored colistin susceptibility and reduced the transcription of pmrA and pmrK to basal levels, while expression of PmrB(L82R) in KPB-1 did not alter colistin susceptibility or upregulate pmrA and pmrK expression, confirming the dominance of wild-type PmrB versus the PmrB(L82R) mutant. The present results indicated that PmrB mutations mediating colistin resistance may be selected during low-dosage colistin treatment. The colistin-resistant phenotype of KPB-2 was stable for up to 50 generations in the absence of selective pressure and was not associated with a significant fitness cost in a competition experiment.},

abstract = {When estimating causal effects using observational data, it is desirable to replicate a randomized experiment as closely as possible by obtaining treated and control groups with similar covariate distributions. This goal can often be achieved by choosing well-matched samples of the original treated and control groups, thereby reducing bias due to the covariates. Since the 1970's, work on matching methods has examined how to best choose treated and control subjects for comparison. Matching methods are gaining popularity in fields such as economics, epidemiology, medicine, and political science. However, until now the literature and related advice has been scattered across disciplines. Researchers who are interested in using matching methods-or developing methods related to matching-do not have a single place to turn to learn about past and current research. This paper provides a structure for thinking about matching methods and guidance on their use, coalescing the existing research (both old and new) and providing a summary of where the literature on matching methods is now and where it should be headed.},

abstract = {Pacific Biosciences has developed a method for real-time sequencing of single DNA molecules (Eid et al., 2009), with intrinsic sequencing rates of several bases per second and read lengths into the kilobase range. Conceptually, this sequencing approach is based on eavesdropping on the activity of DNA polymerase carrying out template-directed DNA polymerization. Performed in a highly parallel operational mode, sequential base additions catalyzed by each polymerase are detected with terminal phosphate-linked, fluorescence-labeled nucleotides. This chapter will first outline the principle of this single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) DNA sequencing method, followed by descriptions of its underlying components and typical sequencing run conditions. Two examples are provided which illustrate that, in addition to the DNA sequence, the dynamics of DNA polymerization from each enzyme molecules is directly accessible: the determination of base-specific kinetic parameters from single-molecule sequencing reads, and the characterization of DNA synthesis rate heterogeneities.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The computation of large phylogenetic trees with statistical models such as maximum likelihood or bayesian inference is computationally extremely intensive. It has repeatedly been demonstrated that these models are able to recover the true tree or a tree which is topologically closer to the true tree more frequently than less elaborate methods such as parsimony or neighbor joining. Due to the combinatorial and computational complexity the size of trees which can be computed on a Biologist's PC workstation within reasonable time is limited to trees containing approximately 100 taxa.

RESULTS: In this paper we present the latest release of our program RAxML-III for rapid maximum likelihood-based inference of large evolutionary trees which allows for computation of 1.000-taxon trees in less than 24 hours on a single PC processor. We compare RAxML-III to the currently fastest implementations for maximum likelihood and bayesian inference: PHYML and MrBayes. Whereas RAxML-III performs worse than PHYML and MrBayes on synthetic data it clearly outperforms both programs on all real data alignments used in terms of speed and final likelihood values.

However, the EHR is not structured to provide data for such purposes: most clinical information is entered as free text and content varies substantially between providers. Discrete information on patients' functional status is typically not collected. Data extraction tools are often unavailable. We have developed the Knowledge Program (KP), a comprehensive initiative to improve the collection of discrete clinical information into the EHR and the retrievability of data for use in research, quality, and patient care. A distinct feature of the KP is the systematic collection of patient-reported outcomes, which is captured discretely, allowing more refined analyses of care outcomes. The KP capitalizes on features of the Epic EHR and utilizes an external IT infrastructure distinct from Epic for enhanced functionality. Here, we describe the development and implementation of the KP.},

abstract = {A new form of matching{\^{a}}€“optimal balanced risk set matching{\^{a}}€“is applied in an observational study of a treatment, cystoscopy and hydrodistention, given in response to the symptoms of the chronic, nonlethal disease interstitial cystitis. When a patient receives the treatment at time t, that patient is matched to another patient with a similar history of symptoms up to time t who has not received the treatment up to time t; this is risk set matching. By using a penalty function in integer programming in a new way, we force the marginal distributions of symptoms to be balanced in the matched treated and control groups. Among all balanced matchings, we pick the one that is optimal in the sense of minimizing the multivariate pretreatment covariate distance within matched pairs. Under a simple model for the treatment assignment mechanism, we study the sensitivity of the findings to hidden biases. In particular, we show that a simple, conventional sensitivity analysis is appropriate with risk set matching when the time to treatment follows a proportional hazards model with a time-dependent unobserved covariate.},

abstract = {The identification of temporal clusters of healthcare-associated colonizations or infections is a challenge in infection control. WHONET software is available to achieve these objectives using laboratory databases of hospitals but it has never been compared with SaTScan regarding its detection performance. This study provided the opportunity to evaluate the performance of WHONET software in comparison with SaTScan software as a reference to detect clusters of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A retrospective study was conducted in two French university hospitals. Cases of P. aeruginosa colonizations or infections occurring between 1st January 2005 and 30th April 2014 in the first hospital were analyzed overall and by medical ward/care unit. Poisson temporal and space-time permutation models were used. Analyses were repeated for the second hospital on data from 1st July 2007 to 31st December 2013 to validate WHONET software (in comparison with SaTScan) in another setting. During the study period, 3,946 isolates of P. aeruginosa were recovered from 2,996 patients in the first hospital. The incidence rate was 89.8 per 100,000 patient-days (95{\%} CI [87.0; 92.6]). Several clusters were observed overall and at the unit level and some of these were detected whatever the method used. WHONET results were consistent with the analyses that took patient-days and temporal trends into account in both hospitals. Because it is more flexible and easier to use than SaTScan, WHONET software seems to be a useful tool for the prospective surveillance of hospital data although it does not take populations at risk into account.},

This analysis presents the results of the first FlowCAP challenges.

This increasing volume of data requires tools that can quickly compare multiple whole-genome sequences, millions of base pairs in length, to aid in the study of populations, pan-genomes, and genome evolution.

RESULTS: We present a new multiple alignment tool for whole genomes named Mugsy. Mugsy is computationally efficient and can align 31 Streptococcus pneumoniae genomes in less than 2 hours producing alignments that compare favorably to other tools. Mugsy is also the fastest program evaluated for the multiple alignment of assembled human chromosome sequences from four individuals. Mugsy does not require a reference sequence, can align mixtures of assembled draft and completed genome data, and is robust in identifying a rich complement of genetic variation including duplications, rearrangements, and large-scale gain and loss of sequence.

abstract = {Mounting evidence suggests that natural populations can harbor extensive fitness diversity with numerous genomic loci under selection. It is also known that genealogical trees for populations under selection are quantifiably different from those expected under neutral evolution and described statistically by Kingman's coalescent. While differences in the statistical structure of genealogies have long been used as a test for the presence of selection, the full extent of the information that they contain has not been exploited. Here we shall demonstrate that the shape of the reconstructed genealogical tree for a moderately large number of random genomic samples taken from a fitness diverse, but otherwise unstructured asexual population can be used to predict the relative fitness of individuals within the sample. To achieve this we define a heuristic algorithm, which we test in silico using simulations of a Wright-Fisher model for a realistic range of mutation rates and selection strength. Our inferred fitness ranking is based on a linear discriminator which identifies rapidly coalescing lineages in the reconstructed tree. Inferred fitness ranking correlates strongly with actual fitness, with a genome in the top 10{\%} ranked being in the top 20{\%} fittest with false discovery rate of 0.1-0.3 depending on the mutation/selection parameters. The ranking also enables to predict the genotypes that future populations inherit from the present one. While the inference accuracy increases monotonically with sample size, samples of 200 nearly saturate the performance. We propose that our approach can be used for inferring relative fitness of genomes obtained in single-cell sequencing of tumors and in monitoring viral outbreaks.},

The recent emergence or reemergence of CHIKV in the Indian Ocean Islands and India has stressed the need to better understand the pathogenesis of this disease. Previous CHIKV disease models have used young or immunodeficient mice, but these do not recapitulate human disease patterns and are unsuitable for testing immune-based therapies. Herein, we describe what we believe to be a new model for CHIKV infection in adult, immunocompetent cynomolgus macaques. CHIKV infection in these animals recapitulated the viral, clinical, and pathological features observed in human disease. In the macaques, long-term CHIKV infection was observed in joints, muscles, lymphoid organs, and liver, which could explain the long-lasting CHIKV disease symptoms observed in humans.

abstract = {Genome browsers are widely used tools for the visualization of a genome and related data. The demands placed on genome browsers due to the size, variety, and complexity of the data pro- duced by modern biotechnology is increasing. These demands are poorly understood, and are not documented. Our study is establishing and documenting a clear set of requirements for genome browsers. Our study reviewed all widely used genome browsers, as well as notable research prototypes of genome browsers. This involved a review of the literature, executing typical uses of the genome browsers, program comprehension, reverse engineering, and code analysis. The key outcome of the study is a clear set of requirements in the form of a requirement document which conforms to the IEEE Std 830-1998 Standard of a Software Requirement Specification. This contains a domain model of concepts, the functional requirements as use cases, a definition of visualizations as metaphors, glyphs, or icons, formal specification of the system in Z notation and a specification of all widely used file formats. Genome browsers share a set of basic features like display, scroll, zoom, and search. How- ever, they differ in their performance, maturity level and the implementation technologies. Our requirements also document the major non-functional requirements. The outcome of our study can be used in several ways: it can be used as a guide for future developers of Genome Browsers; it can form the basis of future enhancements of features in existing genome browsers; and it can motivate the invention of new algorithms, data structures, or file formats for implementations.},

abstract = {Analogous to observations in RNA viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, genetic variation associated with intrahost dengue virus (DENV) populations has been postulated to influence viral fitness and disease pathogenesis. Previous attempts to investigate intrahost genetic variation in DENV characterized only a few viral genes or a limited number of full-length genomes. We developed a whole-genome amplification approach coupled with deep sequencing to capture intrahost diversity across the entire coding region of DENV-2. Using this approach, we sequenced DENV-2 genomes from the serum of 22 Nicaraguan individuals with secondary DENV infection and captured ∼75{\%} of the DENV genome in each sample (range, 40 to 98{\%}). We identified and quantified variants using a highly sensitive and specific method and determined that the extent of diversity was considerably lower than previous estimates. Significant differences in intrahost diversity were detected between genes and also between antigenically distinct domains of the Envelope gene. Interestingly, a strong association was discerned between the extent of intrahost diversity in a few genes and viral clade identity. Additionally, the abundance of viral variants within a host, as well as the impact of viral mutations on amino acid encoding and predicted protein function, determined whether intrahost variants were observed at the interhost level in circulating Nicaraguan DENV-2 populations, strongly suggestive of purifying selection across transmission events. Our data illustrate the value of high-coverage genome-wide analysis of intrahost diversity for high-resolution mapping of the relationship between intrahost diversity and clinical, epidemiological, and virological parameters of viral infection.},

We also included isolates from other UK locations, historical isolates from Brighton, and previous data from a US study. Samples from symptomatic patients and asymptomatic sexual health screening underwent nucleic acid amplification testing; positive samples and all samples from symptomatic patients were cultured for N gonorrhoeae, and resulting isolates were whole-genome sequenced. Cefixime susceptibility testing was done in selected isolates by agar incorporation, and we used sequence data to determine multi-antigen sequence types and penA genotypes. We derived a transmission nomogram to determine the plausibility of direct or indirect transmission between any two cases depending on the time between samples: estimated mutation rates, plus diversity noted within patients across anatomical sites and probable transmission pairs, were used to fit a coalescent model to determine the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms expected. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nFINDINGS$\backslash$n1407 (98{\%}) of 1437 Brighton isolates between Jan 1, 2011, and March 9, 2015 were successfully sequenced.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The use of antibiotics for the treatment of infectious diseases has led to important changes in the structure of pathogenic bacterial populations. However, these changes could be buffered if the expression of antibiotic resistance genes were to lead to the counter-selection of antibiotic-resistant strains in antibiotic-free environments. To test the effect of antibiotic resistance on bacterial fitness, we analysed the effect of the overproduction of the multidrug efflux pump SmeDEF on the physiology of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. SmeDEF confers resistance to antibiotics belonging to different structural families, and its overexpression is associated with an antibiotic resistance phenotype in clinical isolates of S. maltophilia. RESULTS: Two S. maltophilia isogenic strains were analysed: the wild-type strain D457 and strain D457R, which is a SmeDEF overproducer. In co-culture experiments, under non-selective pressure the wild-type strain displaced the mutant strain D457R. Metabolic profiling showed that SmeDEF overproduction leads to several changes in S. maltophilia metabolism. Using a Dictyostelium discoideum model of bacterial virulence, we found overexpression of SmeDEF to be associated with a reduction in S. maltophilia virulence. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data indicate that overexpression of the multidrug efflux pump SmeDEF causes a metabolic burden for S. maltophilia.},

Current control measures do not target asymptomatic carriers, despite evidence that they can contaminate the hospital environment and health care workers' hands and potentially transmit C difficile to other patients. Objective To investigate the effect of detecting and isolating C difficile asymptomatic carriers at hospital admission on the incidence of health care-associated CDI (HA-CDI). Design, Setting, and Participants We performed a controlled quasi-experimental study between November 19, 2013, and March 7, 2015, in a Canadian acute care facility. Admission screening was conducted by detecting the tcdB gene by polymerase chain reaction on a rectal swab. Carriers were placed under contact isolation precautions during their hospitalization. Main Outcomes and Measures Changes in HA-CDI incidence level and trend during the intervention period (17 periods of 4 weeks each) were compared with the preintervention control period (120 periods of 4 weeks each) by segmented regression analysis and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modeling. Concomitant changes in the aggregated HA-CDI incidence at other institutions in Qu{\'{e}}bec City, Qu{\'{e}}bec (n = 6) and the province of Qu{\'{e}}bec (n = 94) were also examined. Results Overall, 7599 of 8218 (92.5{\%}) eligible patients were screened, among whom 368 (4.8{\%}) were identified as C difficile carriers. During the intervention, 38 patients (3.0 per 10 000 patient-days) developed an HA-CDI compared with 416 patients (6.9 per 10 000 patient-days) during the preintervention control period (P {\textless} .001). There was no immediate change in the level of HA-CDIs on implementation (P = .92), but there was a significant decrease in trend over time of 7{\%} per 4-week period (rate ratio, 0.93; 95{\%} CI, 0.87-0.99 per period; P = .02). ARIMA modeling also detected a significant effect of the intervention, represented by a gradual progressive decrease in the HA-CDI time series by an overall magnitude of 7.2 HA-CDIs per 10 000 patient-days. We estimated that the intervention had prevented 63 of the 101 (62.4{\%}) expected cases. By contrast, no significant decrease in HA-CDI rates occurred in the control groups. Conclusions and Relevance Detecting and isolating C difficile carriers was associated with a significant decrease in the incidence of HA-CDI. If confirmed in subsequent studies, this strategy could help prevent HA-CDI.},

abstract = {Bacteria show remarkable adaptability in the face of antibiotic therapeutics. Resistance alleles in drug target-specific sites and general stress responses have been identified in individual end-point isolates. Less is known, however, about the population dynamics during the development of antibiotic-resistant strains. Here we follow a continuous culture of Escherichia coli facing increasing levels of antibiotic and show that the vast majority of isolates are less resistant than the population as a whole. We find that the few highly resistant mutants improve the survival of the population's less resistant constituents, in part by producing indole, a signalling molecule generated by actively growing, unstressed cells. We show, through transcriptional profiling, that indole serves to turn on drug efflux pumps and oxidative-stress protective mechanisms. The indole production comes at a fitness cost to the highly resistant isolates, and whole-genome sequencing reveals that this bacterial altruism is made possible by drug-resistance mutations unrelated to indole production. This work establishes a population-based resistance mechanism constituting a form of kin selection whereby a small number of resistant mutants can, at some cost to themselves, provide protection to other, more vulnerable, cells, enhancing the survival capacity of the overall population in stressful environments.},

abstract = {The influenza A virus pandemic of 1918-1919 resulted in an estimated 20-40 million deaths worldwide. The hemagglutinin and neuraminidase sequences of the 1918 virus were previously determined. We here report the sequence of the A/Brevig Mission/1/18 (H1N1) virus nonstructural (NS) segment encoding two proteins, NS1 and nuclear export protein. Phylogenetically, these genes appear to be close to the common ancestor of subsequent human and classical swine strain NS genes. Recently, the influenza A virus NS1 protein was shown to be a type I IFN antagonist that plays an important role in viral pathogenesis. By using the recently developed technique of generating influenza A viruses entirely from cloned cDNAs, the hypothesis that the 1918 virus NS1 gene played a role in virulence was tested in a mouse model. In a BSL3+ laboratory, viruses were generated that possessed either the 1918 NS1 gene alone or the entire 1918 NS segment in a background of influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1), a mouse-adapted virus derived from a human influenza strain first isolated in 1933. These 1918 NS viruses replicated well in tissue culture but were attenuated in mice as compared with the isogenic control viruses. This attenuation in mice may be related to the human origin of the 1918 NS1 gene. These results suggest that interaction of the NS1 protein with host-cell factors plays a significant role in viral pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Seasonal influenza epidemics are a major public health concern, causing tens of millions of respiratory illnesses and 250,000 to 500,000 deaths worldwide each year. In addition to seasonal influenza, a new strain of influenza virus against which no previous immunity exists and that demonstrates human-to-human transmission could result in a pandemic with millions of fatalities. Early detection of disease activity, when followed by a rapid response, can reduce the impact of both seasonal and pandemic influenza. One way to improve early detection is to monitor health-seeking behaviour in the form of queries to online search engines, which are submitted by millions of users around the world each day. Here we present a method of analysing large numbers of Google search queries to track influenza-like illness in a population. Because the relative frequency of certain queries is highly correlated with the percentage of physician visits in which a patient presents with influenza-like symptoms, we can accurately estimate the current level of weekly influenza activity in each region of the United States, with a reporting lag of about one day. This approach may make it possible to use search queries to detect influenza epidemics in areas with a large population of web search users.},

abstract = {CTXphi is a filamentous, lysogenic bacteriophage whose genome encodes cholera toxin, the primary virulence factor produced by Vibrio cholerae. CTX prophages in O1 El Tor and O139 strains of V. cholerae are found within arrays of genetically related elements integrated at a single locus within the V. cholerae large chromosome. The prophages of O1 El Tor and O139 strains generally yield infectious CTXphi. In contrast, O1 classical strains of V. cholerae do not produce CTXphi, although they produce cholera toxin and they contain CTX prophages integrated at two sites. We have identified the second site of CTX prophage integration in O1 classical strains and characterized the classical prophage arrays genetically and functionally. The genes of classical prophages encode functional forms of all of the proteins needed for production of CTXphi. Classical CTX prophages are present either as solitary prophages or as arrays of two truncated, fused prophages. RS1, a genetic element that is closely related to CTXphi and is often interspersed with CTX prophages in El Tor strains, was not detected in classical V. cholerae. Our model for CTXphi production predicts that the CTX prophage arrangements in classical strains will not yield extrachromosomal CTX DNA and thus will not yield virions, and our experimental results confirm this prediction. Thus, failure of O1 classical strains of V. cholerae to produce CTXphi is due to overall deficiencies in the structures of the arrays of classical prophages, rather than to mutations affecting individual CTX prophage genes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Effective management and treatment of cancer continues to be complicated by the rapid evolution and resulting heterogeneity of tumors. Phylogenetic study of cell populations in single tumors provides a way to delineate intra-tumoral heterogeneity and identify robust features of evolutionary processes. The introduction of single-cell sequencing has shown great promise for advancing single-tumor phylogenetics; however, the volume and high noise in these data present challenges for inference, especially with regard to chromosome abnormalities that typically dominate tumor evolution. Here, we investigate a strategy to use such data to track differences in tumor cell genomic content during progression.RESULTS:We propose a reference-free approach to mining single-cell genome sequence reads to allow predictive classification of tumors into heterogeneous cell types and reconstruct models of their evolution. The approach extracts k-mer counts from single-cell tumor genomic DNA sequences, and uses differences in normalized k-mer frequencies as a proxy for overall evolutionary distance between distinct cells. The approach computationally simplifies deriving phylogenetic markers, which normally relies on first aligning sequence reads to a reference genome and then processing the data to extract meaningful progression markers for constructing phylogenetic trees. The approach also provides a way to bypass some of the challenges that massive genome rearrangement typical of tumor genomes presents for reference-based methods. We illustrate the method on a publicly available breast tumor single-cell sequencing dataset.CONCLUSIONS:We have demonstrated a computational approach for learning tumor progression from single cell sequencing data using k-mer counts. k-mer features classify tumor cells by stage of progression with high accuracy. Phylogenies built from these k-mer spectrum distance matrices yield splits that are statistically significant when tested for their ability to partition cells at different stages of cancer.},

Antibiotic resistance genes also have the potential to be used for bio-terror purposes through genetically modified organisms.

Each gene and resistance type is annotated with rich information, including resistance profile, mechanism of action, ontology, COG and CDD annotations, as well as external links to sequence and protein databases. Our database also supports sequence similarity searches and implements an initial version of a tool for characterizing common mutations that confer antibiotic resistance. The information we provide can be used as compendium of antibiotic resistance factors as well as to identify the resistance genes of newly sequenced genes, genomes, or metagenomes. Currently, ARDB contains resistance information for 13,293 genes, 377 types, 257 antibiotics, 632 genomes, 933 species and 124 genera. ARDB is available at http://ardb.cbcb.umd.edu/.},

abstract = {Monocytes are primitive hematopoietic cells that primarily arise from the bone marrow, circulate in the peripheral blood and give rise to differentiated macrophages. Over the past two decades, considerable attention to monocyte diversity and macrophage polarization has provided contextual clues into the role of myelomonocytic derivatives in human disease. Until recently, human monocytes were subdivided based on expression of the surface marker CD16. "Classical" monocytes express surface markers denoted as CD14(++)CD16(-) and account for greater than 70{\%} of total monocyte count, while "non-classical" monocytes express the CD16 antigen with low CD14 expression (CD14(+)CD16(++)). However, recognition of an intermediate population identified as CD14(++)CD16(+) supports the new paradigm that monocytes are a true heterogeneous population and careful identification of specific subpopulations is necessary for understanding monocyte function in human disease. Comparative studies of monocytes in mice have yielded more dichotomous results based on expression of the Ly6C antigen. In this review, we will discuss the use of monocyte subpopulations as biomarkers of human disease and summarize correlative studies in mice that may yield significant insight into the contribution of each subset to disease pathogenesis.},

Although most large clinical trials in which results evolve over time are monitored for early evidence of efficacy or toxicity, trials are rarely terminated because the probability of a positive result regarding the value of the innovation has become low. This paper discusses the issues involved in the monitoring and early termination of long-term clinical trials and describes the futility index, a probabilistic basis for early termination of trials of innovative therapy when the accumulated data imply small probability of success. Utilization of the futility index in the management of clinical trials of innovations can be of value in reducing, at slight loss of power, the number of unproductive studies carried to completion, thereby creating new opportunities for more effective use of limited resources.},

abstract = {Background: Variations in testing for Clostridium difficile infection can hinder patients' care, increase the risk of transmission, and skew epidemiological data. We aimed to measure the underdiagnosis of C difficile infection across Europe. Methods: We did a questionnaire-based study at 482 participating hospitals across 20 European countries. Hospitals were questioned about their methods and testing policy for C difficile infection during the periods September, 2011, to August, 2012, and September, 2012, to August, 2013. On one day in winter, 2012-13 (December, 2012, or January, 2013), and summer, 2013 (July or August), every hospital sent all diarrhoeal samples submitted to their microbiology laboratory to a national coordinating laboratory for standardised testing of C difficile infection. Our primary outcome measures were the rates of testing for and cases of C difficile infection per 10 000 patient bed-days. Results of local and national C difficile infection testing were compared with each other. If the result was positive at the national laboratory but negative at the local hospital, the result was classified as undiagnosed C difficile infection. We compared differences in proportions with the Mann-Whitney test, or McNemar's test if data were matched. Findings: During the study period, participating hospitals reported a mean of 65.8 tests (country range 4.6-223.3) for C difficile infection per 10 000 patient-bed days and a mean of 7.0 cases (country range 0.7-28.7) of C difficile infection per 10 000 patient-bed days. Only two-fifths of hospitals reported using optimum methods for testing of C difficile infection (defined by European guidelines), although the number of participating hospitals using optimum methods increased during the study period, from 152 (32{\%}) of 468 in 2011-12 to 205 (48{\%}) of 428 in 2012-13. Across all 482 European hospitals on the two sampling days, 148 (23{\%}) of 641 samples positive for C difficile infection (as determined by the national laboratory) were not diagnosed by participating hospitals because of an absence of clinical suspicion, equating to about 74 missed diagnoses per day. Interpretation: A wide variety of testing strategies for C difficile infection are used across Europe. Absence of clinical suspicion and suboptimum laboratory diagnostic methods mean that an estimated 40 000 inpatients with C difficile infection are potentially undiagnosed every year in 482 European hospitals.

abstract = {We have developed a general profile for the proteins of the TetR family of repressors. The stretch that best defines the profile of this family is made up of 47 amino acid residues that correspond to the helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif and adjacent regions in the three-dimensional structures of TetR, QacR, CprB, and EthR, four family members for which the function and three-dimensional structure are known. We have detected a set of 2,353 nonredundant proteins belonging to this family by screening genome and protein databases with the TetR profile. Proteins of the TetR family have been found in 115 genera of gram-positive, alpha-, beta-, and gamma-proteobacteria, cyanobacteria, and archaea. The set of genes they regulate is known for 85 out of the 2,353 members of the family. These proteins are involved in the transcriptional control of multidrug efflux pumps, pathways for the biosynthesis of antibiotics, response to osmotic stress and toxic chemicals, control of catabolic pathways, differentiation processes, and pathogenicity. The regulatory network in which the family member is involved can be simple, as in TetR (i.e., TetR bound to the target operator represses tetA transcription and is released in the presence of tetracycline), or more complex, involving a series of regulatory cascades in which either the expression of the TetR family member is modulated by another regulator or the TetR family member triggers a cell response to react to environmental insults. Based on what has been learned from the cocrystals of TetR and QacR with their target operators and from their three-dimensional structures in the absence and in the presence of ligands, and based on multialignment analyses of the conserved stretch of 47 amino acids in the 2,353 TetR family members, two groups of residues have been identified. One group includes highly conserved positions involved in the proper orientation of the helix-turn-helix motif and hence seems to play a structural role. The other set of less conserved residues are involved in establishing contacts with the phosphate backbone and target bases in the operator. Information related to the TetR family of regulators has been updated in a database that can be accessed at www.bactregulators.org.},

abstract = {Multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogens present a major burden for hospitals. Rapid cluster identification and pathogen profiling, i.e., of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes, are crucial for effective infection control. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), in particular, is now one of the leading causes of nosocomial infections. In this study, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was applied retrospectively to an unusual spike in MRSA cases in two intensive care units (ICUs) over the course of 4 weeks. While the epidemiological investigation concluded that there were two separate clusters, each associated with one ICU, S. aureus protein A gene (spa) typing data suggested that they belonged to single clonal cluster (all cases shared spa type t001). Standardized gene sets were used to extract an allele-based profile for typing and an antibiotic resistance and toxin gene profile. The WGS results produced high-resolution allelic profiles, which were used to discriminate the MRSA clusters, corroborating the epidemiological investigation and identifying previously unsuspected transmission events. The antibiotic resistance profile was in agreement with the original clinical laboratory susceptibility profile, and the toxin profile provided additional, previously unknown information. WGS coupled with allelic profiling provided a high-resolution method that can be implemented as regular screening for effective infection control.},

abstract = {Public health authorities continuously monitor reported disease cases, looking for patterns that suggest the beginnings of an outbreak. Such analysis increasingly has to be automatized, not least due to the sheer volume of data that is generated across hospitals and clinics on a daily basis. Scan statistics are statistical methods for detecting disease outbreaks in geographic and temporal clusters, which have seen great development in the last 20 years. This thesis contributes to this development by proposing a scan statistic based on the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) distribution, that draws inspiration froma recent article by Can¸ cado et al. (2014). The ZIP distribution is appropriate when some local health centers lack the facilities to diag- nose a given disease or when reported counts are biased downwards; the latter could be due to e.g. underreporting or the lack of access to medical care for uninsured individuals. The performance of the proposed ZIP scan statistic is compared to two other scan statistics, the comparisonmade on both simulated and real outbreak data. Results fromthe simulation study indicate that the proposed scan statistic outperforms the two others, being able to more accurately detect outbreaks. Furthermore, an outbreak of the diarrheal disease cryptosporidiosis in a German city is analyzed; this outbreak was thoroughly investigated in a recent article by Gertler et al. (2015). A final contribution of the thesis is to provide free software in the form of an R package, scanstatistics, which is available online. This package complements existing R packages for disease surveillance and outbreak detection, such as the surveillance package (H{\"{o}}hle et al., 2015).},

abstract = {SUMMARY: Hierarchical clustering is a widely used method for detecting clusters in genomic data. Clusters are defined by cutting branches off the dendrogram. A common but inflexible method uses a constant height cutoff value; this method exhibits suboptimal performance on complicated dendrograms. We present the Dynamic Tree Cut R package that implements novel dynamic branch cutting methods for detecting clusters in a dendrogram depending on their shape. Compared to the constant height cutoff method, our techniques offer the following advantages: (1) they are capable of identifying nested clusters; (2) they are flexible-cluster shape parameters can be tuned to suit the application at hand; (3) they are suitable for automation; and (4) they can optionally combine the advantages of hierarchical clustering and partitioning around medoids, giving better detection of outliers. We illustrate the use of these methods by applying them to protein-protein interaction network data and to a simulated gene expression data set. AVAILABILITY: The Dynamic Tree Cut method is implemented in an R package available at http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/BranchCutting.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies generate millions of sequence reads from DNA/RNA molecules rapidly and cost-effectively, enabling single investigator laboratories to address a variety of 'omics' questions in nonmodel organisms, fundamentally changing the way genomic approaches are used to advance biological research. One major challenge posed by HTS is the complexity and difficulty of data quality control (QC). While QC issues associated with sample isolation, library preparation and sequencing are well known and protocols for their handling are widely available, the QC of the actual sequence reads generated by HTS is often overlooked. HTS-generated sequence reads can contain various errors, biases and artefacts whose identification and amelioration can greatly impact subsequent data analysis. However, a systematic survey on QC procedures for HTS data is still lacking. In this review, we begin by presenting standard 'health check-up' QC procedures recommended for HTS data sets and establishing what 'healthy' HTS data look like. We next proceed by classifying errors, biases and artefacts present in HTS data into three major types of 'pathologies', discussing their causes and symptoms and illustrating with examples their diagnosis and impact on downstream analyses. We conclude this review by offering examples of successful 'treatment' protocols and recommendations on standard practices and treatment options. Notwithstanding the speed with which HTS technologies - and consequently their pathologies - change, we argue that careful QC of HTS data is an important - yet often neglected - aspect of their application in molecular ecology, and lay the groundwork for developing a HTS data QC 'best practices' guide.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has emerged as an important opportunistic pathogen, causing infections whose management is often problematic due to its inherent resistance to many antibiotics, making co-trimoxazole the main therapeutic option. However, there are cases in which either due to antimicrobial resistance or allergic reactions and intolerance to co-trimoxazole this antibiotic cannot be administered. We sought to evaluate the available clinical evidence regarding potentially effective alternative antibiotics for the treatment of S. maltophilia infections. METHODS: The literature search was performed in the PubMed and Scopus databases. The search string used was 'Stenotrophomonas maltophilia OR Xanthomonas maltophilia'. RESULTS: Thirty-one case reports and 5 case series were retrieved including a total of 49 patients with a variety of infections. Twenty of 49 cases (40.8{\%}) were treated with ciprofloxacin as monotherapy or in combination with other antibiotics; 12 of 49 cases (24.5{\%}) were treated with ceftriaxone- or ceftazidime-based regimens; and 6 of 49 cases (12.2{\%}) were treated with ticarcillin- or ticarcillin/clavulanate-based regimens. The cure or improvement rates were 18 cases (90{\%}), 8 (75{\%}) and 4 (66.7{\%}), respectively. The remaining 11 patients received various antimicrobials including aminoglycoside-based regimens, carbapenems, levofloxacin, chloramphenicol, aztreonam, minocycline and other beta-lactams. CONCLUSIONS: The limited available data suggest that ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime or ceftriaxone, and ticarcillin/clavulanate, alone or in combination with other antibiotics, may be considered as alternative options beyond co-trimoxazole.},

abstract = {Exploiting pathogen genomes to reconstruct transmission represents a powerful tool in the fight against infectious disease. However, their interpretation rests on a number of simplifying assumptions that regularly ignore important complexities of real data, in particular within-host evolution and non-sampled patients. Here we propose a new approach to transmission inference called SCOTTI (Structured COalescent Transmission Tree Inference). This method is based on a statistical framework that models each host as a distinct population, and transmissions between hosts as migration events. Our computationally efficient implementation of this model enables the inference of host-to-host transmission while accommodating within-host evolution and non-sampled hosts. SCOTTI is distributed as an open source package for the phylogenetic software BEAST2. We show that SCOTTI can generally infer transmission events even in the presence of considerable within-host variation, can account for the uncertainty associated with the possible presence of non-sampled hosts, and can efficiently use data from multiple samples of the same host, although there is some reduction in accuracy when samples are collected very close to the infection time. We illustrate the features of our approach by investigating transmission from genetic and epidemiological data in a Foot and Mouth Disease Virus (FMDV) veterinary outbreak in England and a Klebsiella pneumoniae outbreak in a Nepali neonatal unit. Transmission histories inferred with SCOTTI will be important in devising effective measures to prevent and halt transmission.},

abstract = {It has unambiguously been shown that genetic, environmental, demographic, and technical factors may have substantial effects on gene expression levels. In addition to the measured variable(s) of interest, there will tend to be sources of signal due to factors that are unknown, unmeasured, or too complicated to capture through simple models. We show that failing to incorporate these sources of heterogeneity into an analysis can have widespread and detrimental effects on the study. Not only can this reduce power or induce unwanted dependence across genes, but it can also introduce sources of spurious signal to many genes. This phenomenon is true even for well-designed, randomized studies. We introduce "surrogate variable analysis" (SVA) to overcome the problems caused by heterogeneity in expression studies. SVA can be applied in conjunction with standard analysis techniques to accurately capture the relationship between expression and any modeled variables of interest. We apply SVA to disease class, time course, and genetics of gene expression studies. We show that SVA increases the biological accuracy and reproducibility of analyses in genome-wide expression studies.},

@article{Serbina2008,
abstract = {Circulating blood monocytes supply peripheral tissues with macrophage and dendritic cell (DC) precursors and, in the setting of infection, also contribute directly to immune defense against microbial pathogens. In humans and mice, monocytes are divided into two major subsets that either specifically traffic into inflamed tissues or, in the absence of overt inflammation, constitutively maintain tissue macrophage/DC populations. Inflammatory monocytes respond rapidly to microbial stimuli by secreting cytokines and antimicrobial factors, express the CCR2 chemokine receptor, and traffic to sites of microbial infection in response to monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 (CCL2) secretion. In murine models, CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment is essential for defense against Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Toxoplasma gondii, and Cryptococcus neoformans infection, implicating inflammatory monocytes in defense against bacterial, protozoal, and fungal pathogens. Recent studies indicate that inflammatory monocyte recruitment to sites of infection is complex, involving CCR2-mediated emigration of monocytes from the bone marrow into the bloodstream, followed by trafficking into infected tissues. The in vivo mechanisms that promote chemokine secretion, monocyte differentiation and trafficking, and finally monocyte-mediated microbial killing remain active and important areas of investigation.},

@article{Didelot2010,
abstract = {Bacteria and archaea reproduce clonally, but sporadically import DNA into their chromosomes from other organisms. In many of these events, the imported DNA replaces an homologous segment in the recipient genome. Here we present a new method to reconstruct the history of recombination events that affected a given sample of bacterial genomes. We introduce a mathematical model that represents both the donor and the recipient of each DNA import as an ancestor of the genomes in the sample. The model represents a simplification of the previously described coalescent with gene conversion. We implement a Monte Carlo Markov chain algorithm to perform inference under this model from sequence data alignments and show that inference is feasible for whole-genome alignments through parallelization. Using simulated data, we demonstrate accurate and reliable identification of individual recombination events and global recombination rate parameters. We applied our approach to an alignment of 13 whole genomes from the Bacillus cereus group. We find, as expected from laboratory experiments, that the recombination rate is higher between closely related organisms and also that the genome contains several broad regions of elevated levels of recombination. Application of the method to the genomic data sets that are becoming available should reveal the evolutionary history and private lives of populations of bacteria and archaea. The methods described in this article have been implemented in a computer software package, ClonalOrigin, which is freely available from http://code.google.com/p/clonalorigin/.},

abstract = {Isolation of antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antibody fragments relies on high-throughput screening of immortalized B cells or recombinant antibody libraries. We bypassed the screening step by using high-throughput DNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis to mine antibody variable region (V)-gene repertoires from bone marrow plasma cells (BMPC) of immunized mice. BMPCs, which cannot be immortalized, produce the vast majority of circulating antibodies. We found that the V-gene repertoire of BMPCs becomes highly polarized after immunization, with the most abundant sequences represented at frequencies between approximately 1{\%} and {\textgreater}10{\%} of the total repertoire. We paired the most abundant variable heavy (V(H)) and variable light (V(L)) genes based on their relative frequencies, reconstructed them using automated gene synthesis, and expressed recombinant antibodies in bacteria or mammalian cells. Antibodies generated in this manner from six mice, each immunized with one of three antigens were overwhelmingly antigen specific (21/27 or 78{\%}). Those generated from a mouse with high serum titers had nanomolar binding affinities.},

Upon infection, dramatic changes occur with the localization, migration, and proliferation of the immune cells to first alert the body of the danger, confine it to limit spreading, and finally extinguish the threat and bring the tissue back to homeostasis. Since current technologies can follow the dynamics of only a limited number of cell types, we have yet to grasp the full complexity of global in vivo cell dynamics in normal developmental processes and disease. Here, we devise a computational method, digital cell quantification (DCQ), which combines genome-wide gene expression data with an immune cell compendium to infer in vivo changes in the quantities of 213 immune cell subpopulations. DCQ was applied to study global immune cell dynamics in mice lungs at ten time points during 7 days of flu infection. We find dramatic changes in quantities of 70 immune cell types, including various innate, adaptive, and progenitor immune cells. We focus on the previously unreported dynamics of four immune dendritic cell subtypes and suggest a specific role for CD103(+) CD11b(-) DCs in early stages of disease and CD8(+) pDC in late stages of flu infection.},

Strain typing revealed that the cluster was comprised of heterogeneous strains of A. graevenitzii. A change in laboratory procedures for Actinomyces cultures was coincident with the emergence of the pseudo-outbreak, and we determined that A. graevenitzii isolates more readily adopted a white, dry, molar tooth appearance on anaerobic colistin nalidixic acid (CNA) agar which likely facilitated its detection and identification in bronchoscopic specimens. This unusual pseudo-outbreak was related to frequent requests of bronchoscopists for Actinomyces cultures combined with a change in microbiology laboratory practices.},

Patients ≥18 years old with a positive culture for S. maltophilia and clinical signs of infection who received treatment for ≥48 h were included. Microbiological cure and clinical response were evaluated at the end of therapy (EOT). In-hospital mortality and isolation of nonsusceptible isolates were also evaluated. Thirty-five patients received SXT, and 63 patients received FQ; 48 patients received levofloxacin, and 15 patients received ciprofloxacin. The most common infection was pulmonary. The overall microbiological cure rate at EOT was 63{\%}. Thirteen of 20 patients (65{\%}) who received SXT and 23 of 37 patients (62{\%}) who received FQ had microbiological cure at EOT (P = 0.832). The overall clinical success rate was 55{\%}, 52{\%} for those who received FQ and 61{\%} for those who received SXT (P = 0.451). In-hospital mortality was 24{\%}, with similar rates in the two groups (25{\%} for FQ versus 22{\%} for SXT; P = 0.546). Development of resistance on repeat culture was 30{\%} for FQ and 20{\%} for SXT (P = 0.426). Fluoroquinolone and SXT monotherapies may be equally effective for the treatment of S. maltophilia infections. Resistance was documented in subsequent isolates of S. maltophilia in both groups.},

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Modern techniques can yield the ordering and strandedness of genes on each chromosome of a genome; such data already exists for hundreds of organisms. The evolutionary mechanisms through which the set of the genes of an organism is altered and reordered are of great interest to systematists, evolutionary biologists, comparative genomicists and biomedical researchers. Perhaps the most basic concept in this area is that of evolutionary distance between two genomes: under a given model of genomic evolution, how many events most likely took place to account for the difference between the two genomes? RESULTS: We present a method to estimate the true evolutionary distance between two genomes under the 'double-cut-and-join' (DCJ) model of genome rearrangement, a model under which a single multichromosomal operation accounts for all genomic rearrangement events: inversion, transposition, translocation, block interchange and chromosomal fusion and fission. Our method relies on a simple structural characterization of a genome pair and is both analytically and computationally tractable. We provide analytical results to describe the asymptotic behavior of genomes under the DCJ model, as well as experimental results on a wide variety of genome structures to exemplify the very high accuracy (and low variance) of our estimator. Our results provide a tool for accurate phylogenetic reconstruction from multichromosomal gene rearrangement data as well as a theoretical basis for refinements of the DCJ model to account for biological constraints.

We therefore aimed to critically review and categorize hospital costs and length of hospital stay (LOS) attributable to Clostridium difficile infection and to investigate the economic burden associated with it. A comprehensive literature review selected papers describing the costs and LOS for hospitalized patients as outcomes of CDI, following the use of statisticsto identify costs and LOS solely attributable to CDI. Twenty-four studies were selected. Estimated attributable costs, all ranges expressed in US dollars, were {\$}6,774-{\$}10,212 for CDI requiring admission, {\$}2,992-{\$}29,000 for hospital-acquired CDI, and {\$}2,454-{\$}12,850 where no categorization was made. The ranges for LOS values were 5-13.6, 2.7-21.3, and 2.8-17.9 days, respectively. The categorization of CDI attributable costs allows budget holders to anticipate the cost per CDI case, a perspective that should enrich the design of appropriate incentives for the various budget holders to invest in prevention so that CDI prevention is optimized globally. ?? 2014 The Healthcare Infection Society.},

abstract = {Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging nosocomial pathogen that displays high-level intrinsic resistance to a variety of structurally unrelated antimicrobial agents. Efflux mechanisms are known to contribute to acquired multidrug resistance in this organism, and indeed, one such multidrug efflux system, SmeDEF, was recently identified. Still, the importance of SmeDEF to intrinsic antibiotic resistance in S. maltophilia had not yet been determined. Reverse transcription-PCR confirmed expression of the smeDEF genes in wild-type S. maltophilia, and deletion of smeE or smeF in wild-type strains rendered the mutants hypersusceptible to several antimicrobials, suggesting that SmeDEF contributes to intrinsic antimicrobial resistance in this organism. Expression of smeDEF was also enhanced in an in vitro-selected multidrug-resistant mutant, although deletion of smeF but not of smeE in these mutants compromised antimicrobial resistance. Apparently, hyperexpressed SmeF is capable of functioning with additional multidrug efflux components to promote multidrug resistance in S. maltophilia.},

abstract = {Elevated circulating levels of chemokines have been reported in patients with dengue fever and are proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of dengue disease. To establish in vitro models for chemokine induction by dengue 2 virus (DEN2V), we studied a variety of human cell lines and primary cells. DEN2V infection of HepG2 and primary dendritic cells induced the production of interleukin-8 (IL-8), RANTES, MIP-1, and MIP-1, whereas only IL-8 and RANTES were induced following dengue virus infection of HEK293 cells. Chemokine secretion was accompanied by an increase in steady-state mRNA levels. No chemokine induction was observed in HEK293 cells treated with poly(I:C) or alpha interferon, suggesting a direct effect of virus infection. To determine the mechanism(s) involved in the induction of chemokine production by DEN2V, individual dengue virus genes were cloned into plasmids and expressed in HEK293 cells. Transfection of a plasmid expressing NS5 or a dengue virus replicon induced IL-8 gene expression and secretion. RANTES expression was not induced under these conditions, however. Reporter assays showed that IL-8 induction by NS5 was principally through CAAT/enhancer binding protein, whereas DEN2V infection also induced NF-B. These results indicate a role for the dengue virus NS5 protein in the induction of IL-8 by DEN2V infection. Recruitment and activation of potential target cells to sites of DEN2V replication by virus-induced chemokine production may contribute to viral replication as well as to the inflammatory components of dengue virus disease.},

abstract = {Efficient worldwide swine surveillance for influenza A viruses is urgently needed; the emergence of a novel reassortant pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus in 2009 demonstrated that swine can be the direct source of pandemic influenza and that the pandemic potential of viruses prevalent in swine populations must be monitored. We used the ferret model to assess the pathogenicity and transmissibility of predominant Korean triple-reassortant swine (TRSw) H1N2 and H3N2 influenza viruses genetically related to North American strains. Although most of the TRSw viruses were moderately pathogenic, one [A/Swine/Korea/1204/2009; Sw/1204 (H1N2)] was virulent in ferrets, causing death within 10 d of inoculation, and was efficiently transmitted to naive contact ferrets via respiratory droplets. Although molecular analysis did not reveal known virulence markers, the Sw/1204 virus acquired mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) (Asp-225-Gly) and neuraminidase (NA) (Ser-315-Asn) proteins during the single ferret passage. The contact-Sw/1204 virus became more virulent in mice, replicated efficiently in vitro, extensively infected human lung tissues ex vivo, and maintained its ability to replicate and transmit in swine. Reverse-genetics studies further indicated that the HA(225G) and NA(315N) substitutions contributed substantially in altering virulence and transmissibility. These findings support the continuing threat of some field TRSw viruses to human and animal health, reviving concerns on the capacity of pigs to create future pandemic viruses. Apart from warranting continued and enhanced global surveillance, this study also provides evidence on the emerging roles of HA(225G) and NA(315N) as potential virulence markers in mammals.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Acute chikungunya (CHIKV) is predominantly an acute onset of excruciatingly painful, self-limiting musculoskeletal (MSK) arbovirus illness and this was further reported by us during the 2006 Indian epidemic [Chopra et al. Epidemiol Infect 2012]. Selected serum cytokines profile in subjects within one month of onset of illness is being presented.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Out of 509 clinical CHIKV cases (43{\%} population) identified during a rural population survey, 225 subjects consented blood investigations. 132 examined within 30 days of febrile onset are the study cohort. Anti-CHIKV IgM and IgG antibodies tested by immunochromatography and indirect immunofluorescence respectively. Interferons (IFN)-$\alpha$, -$\beta$ and -$\gamma$, Interferon Gamma-Induced Protein-10 (CXCL-10/IP-10), Tumor Necrosis Factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$), Interleukin-1$\beta$ (IL-1$\beta$), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-13 (IL-13), Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1), Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and Interleukin-10 (IL-10) performed by ELISA. Samples collected from neighboring community a year prior to the epidemic used as healthy controls.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Seropositivity for anti-CHIKV IgM and IgG was 65{\%} and 52{\%} respectively. IFN-$\alpha$, IFN-$\beta$, IFN-$\gamma$, CXCL10/IP-10 and IL-1$\beta$ showed intense response in early acute phase. Cytokines (particularly TNF-$\alpha$, MCP-1, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10) was maximum in extended symptomatic phase and remained elevated in recovered subjects. Higher (p{\textless}0.05) IFN and IL-4 seen in patients seropositive for anti-CHIKV IgG. Elderly cases (≥65 years) showed elevated cytokines (except IFN) and anti-CHIKV antibodies near similar to younger subjects. Significant correlations (p{\textless}0.05) found between cytokines and clinical features (fatigue, low back ache, myalgia) and anti-CHIKV antibodies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: An intense cytokine milieu was evident in the early and immediate persistent symptomatic phase and in recovered subjects. Early persistent IgM and lower IgG to anti-CHKV and intense Th2 cytokine phenotype seem to be associated with delay in resolution of MSK symptoms. Intriguingly, maximum TNF-$\alpha$, IL-6 and IL-13 with low anti-CHIKV IgM response found in subjects recovered from CHIKV within one month of illness.},

Our method uses the longest reads as seeds to recruit all other reads for construction of highly accurate preassembled reads through a directed acyclic graph-based consensus procedure, which we follow with assembly using off-the-shelf long-read assemblers. In contrast to hybrid approaches, HGAP does not require highly accurate raw reads for error correction. We demonstrate efficient genome assembly for several microorganisms using as few as three SMRT Cell zero-mode waveguide arrays of sequencing and for BACs using just one SMRT Cell. Long repeat regions can be successfully resolved with this workflow. We also describe a consensus algorithm that incorporates SMRT sequencing primary quality values to produce de novo genome sequence exceeding 99.999{\%} accuracy.},

abstract = {The NS1 influenza virus gene is thought to play an important role in replication and pathogenicity during infection. Previous studies have shown that mutations in the highly pathogenic avian NS1 influenza virus gene can influence virulence. However, little is known regarding the pathogenic mechanism of the NS1 gene in low pathogenic avian influenza virus. We found that NS1 genes originating from two H3 avian influenza viruses, A/duck/Beijing/40/04 (Dk/BJ/40/04) and A/duck/Beijing/61/05 (Dk/BJ/61/05), possessing three amino acid residue differences at positions 127, 205 and 209 contributed to an altered virulence in rescued NS1 recombinant viruses on a A/WSN/33 (WSN) virus background (WSN:40NS1 and WSN:61NS1) in mice. To further determine the effect on pathogenicity, we generated a series of recombinant viruses with mutations at positions 127, 205 and 209 in the NS1 gene of WSN:61NS1. Experiments in mice indicated that when compared with WSN:61NS1, viruses with only single mutations enhanced incidence of infection in mice but were not lethal. Viruses bearing substitution of two amino acid residues in the NS1 protein replicated well in lung tissue and caused 20-100{\%} mortality in mice. Our findings demonstrate that co-mutation of amino acid residues at multiple positions in the NS1 protein can increase the pathogenicity of influenza virus in mice.},

Pathogen exposure induces the clonal expansion of B cells expressing antibodies that can bind the infectious agent. To assess human B cell responses to trivalent seasonal influenza and monovalent pandemic H1N1 vaccination, we sequenced gene rearrangements encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain, a major determinant of epitope recognition. The magnitude of B cell clonal expansions correlates with an individual's secreted antibody response to the vaccine, and the expanded clones are enriched with those expressing influenza-specific monoclonal antibodies. Additionally, B cell responses to pandemic influenza H1N1 vaccination and infection in different people show a prominent family of convergent antibody heavy chain gene rearrangements specific to influenza antigens. These results indicate that microbes can induce specific signatures of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements and that pathogen exposure can potentially be assessed from B cell repertoires.},

abstract = {The burden of healthcare-associated infections, such as healthcare-acquired Clostridium difficile (HA-CDI), can be expressed in terms of additional length of stay (LOS) and mortality. However, previous estimates have varied widely. Although some have considered time of infection onset (time-dependent bias), none considered the impact of severity of HA-CDI; this was the primary aim of this study. Methods: The daily risk of in-hospital death or discharge was modelled using a Cox proportional hazards model, fitted to data on patients discharged in 2012 from a large English teaching hospital. We treated HA-CDI status as a time-dependent variable and adjusted for confounders. In addition, a multi-state model was developed to provide a clinically intuitive metric of delayed discharge associated with non-severe and severe HA-CDI respectively. Findings: Data comprised 157 (including 48 severe) HA-CDI cases among 42,618 patients. HA-CDI reduced the daily discharge rate by nearly one-quarter [hazard ratio (HR): 0.72; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.61-0.84] and increased the in-hospital death rate by 75{\%} compared with non-HA-CDI patients (HR: 1.75; 95{\%} CI: 1.16-2.62). Whereas overall HA-CDI resulted in a mean excess LOS of about seven days (95{\%} CI: 3.5-10.9), severe cases had an average excess LOS which was twice ({\~{}}11.6 days; 95{\%} CI: 3.6-19.6) that of the non-severe cases (about five days; 95{\%} CI: 1.1-9.5). Conclusion: HA-CDI contributes to patients' expected LOS and risk of mortality. However, when quantifying the health and economic burden of hospital-onset of HA-CDI, the heterogeneity in the impact of HA-CDI should be accounted for.},

We then performed high-throughput genotyping and gene expression profiling and carried out a genome-wide association analyses for more than 100,000 gene expression traits representing four metabolically relevant tissues: liver, omental adipose, subcutaneous adipose, and stomach. We successfully identified 24,531 eSNPs corresponding to about 10,000 distinct genes. This represents the greatest number of eSNPs identified to our knowledge by any study to date and the first study to identify eSNPs from stomach tissue. We then demonstrate how these eSNPs provide a high-quality disease map for each tissue in morbidly obese patients to not only inform genetic associations identified in this cohort, but in previously published genome-wide association studies as well.

abstract = {Variable tandem repeats are frequently used for genetic mapping, genotyping, and forensics studies. Moreover, variation in some repeats underlies rapidly evolving traits or certain diseases. However, mutation rates vary greatly from repeat to repeat, and as a consequence, not all tandem repeats are suitable genetic markers or interesting unstable genetic modules. We developed a model, "SERV," that predicts the variability of a broad range of tandem repeats in a wide range of organisms. The nonlinear model uses three basic characteristics of the repeat (number of repeated units, unit length, and purity) to produce a numeric "VARscore" that correlates with repeat variability. SERV was experimentally validated using a large set of different artificial repeats located in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae URA3 gene. Further in silico analysis shows that SERV outperforms existing models and accurately predicts repeat variability in bacteria and eukaryotes, including plants and humans. Using SERV, we demonstrate significant enrichment of variable repeats within human genes involved in transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling, morphogenesis, and neurogenesis. Moreover, SERV allows identification of known and candidate genes involved in repeat-based diseases. In addition, we demonstrate the use of SERV for the selection and comparison of suitable variable repeats for genotyping and forensic purposes. Our analysis indicates that tandem repeats used for genotyping should have a VARscore between 1 and 3. SERV is publicly available from http://hulsweb1.cgr.harvard.edu/SERV/.},

abstract = {Efficient worldwide swine surveillance for influenza A viruses is urgently needed; the emergence of a novel reassortant pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus in 2009 demonstrated that swine can be the direct source of pandemic influenza and that the pandemic potential of viruses prevalent in swine populations must be monitored. We used the ferret model to assess the pathogenicity and transmissibility of predominant Korean triple-reassortant swine (TRSw) H1N2 and H3N2 influenza viruses genetically related to North American strains. Although most of the TRSw viruses were moderately pathogenic, one [A/Swine/Korea/1204/2009; Sw/1204 (H1N2)] was virulent in ferrets, causing death within 10 d of inoculation, and was efficiently transmitted to naive contact ferrets via respiratory droplets. Although molecular analysis did not reveal known virulence markers, the Sw/1204 virus acquired mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) (Asp-225-Gly) and neuraminidase (NA) (Ser-315-Asn) proteins during the single ferret passage. The contact-Sw/1204 virus became more virulent in mice, replicated efficiently in vitro, extensively infected human lung tissues ex vivo, and maintained its ability to replicate and transmit in swine. Reverse-genetics studies further indicated that the HA(225G) and NA(315N) substitutions contributed substantially in altering virulence and transmissibility. These findings support the continuing threat of some field TRSw viruses to human and animal health, reviving concerns on the capacity of pigs to create future pandemic viruses.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The number of prokaryotic genome sequences becoming available is growing steadily and is growing faster than our ability to accurately annotate them.

DESCRIPTION: We describe a fully automated service for annotating bacterial and archaeal genomes. The service identifies protein-encoding, rRNA and tRNA genes, assigns functions to the genes, predicts which subsystems are represented in the genome, uses this information to reconstruct the metabolic network and makes the output easily downloadable for the user. In addition, the annotated genome can be browsed in an environment that supports comparative analysis with the annotated genomes maintained in the SEED environment. The service normally makes the annotated genome available within 12-24 hours of submission, but ultimately the quality of such a service will be judged in terms of accuracy, consistency, and completeness of the produced annotations. We summarize our attempts to address these issues and discuss plans for incrementally enhancing the service.

CONCLUSION: By providing accurate, rapid annotation freely to the community we have created an important community resource. The service has now been utilized by over 120 external users annotating over 350 distinct genomes.},

The principal aim of this review is to highlight the advances and accomplishments in the field of tissue engineering that could be achieved by culturing cells in Space or by devices created to simulate microgravity on Earth. Understanding the biology of three-dimensional (3D) multicellular structures is very important for a more complete appreciation of in vivo tissue function and advancing in vitro tissue engineering efforts. Various cells exposed to r-$\mu$g in Space or to s-$\mu$g created by a random positioning machine, a 2D-clinostat, or a rotating wall vessel bioreactor grew in the form of 3D tissues. Hence, these methods represent a new strategy for tissue engineering of a variety of tissues, such as regenerated cartilage, artificial vessel constructs, and other organ tissues as well as multicellular cancer spheroids. These aggregates are used to study molecular mechanisms involved in angiogenesis, cancer development, and biology and for pharmacological testing of, for example, chemotherapeutic drugs or inhibitors of neoangiogenesis. Moreover, they are useful for studying multicellular responses in toxicology and radiation biology, or for performing coculture experiments. The future will show whether these tissue-engineered constructs can be used for medical transplantations. Unveiling the mechanisms of microgravity-dependent molecular and cellular changes is an up-to-date requirement for improving Space medicine and developing new treatment strategies that can be translated to in vivo models while reducing the use of laboratory animals.},

abstract = {The virulence of influenza virus is a multigenic trait. One determinant of virulence is the multifunctional NS1 protein that functions in several ways to defeat the cellular innate immune response. Recent large-scale genome sequence analysis of avian influenza virus isolates indicated that four C-terminal residues of the NS1 protein is a PDZ ligand domain of the X-S/T-X-V type and it was speculated that it may represent a virulence determinant. To test this hypothesis, by using mice as a model system, the four C-terminal amino acid residues of a number of influenza virus strains were engineered into the A/WSN/33 virus NS1 protein by reverse genetics and the pathogenicity of the viruses determined. Viruses containing NS1 sequences from the 1918 H1N1 and H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses demonstrated increased virulence in infected mice compared with wt A/WSN/33 virus, as characterized by rapid loss of body weight, decreased survival time, and decreased mean lethal dose. Histopathological analysis of infected mouse lung tissues demonstrated severe alveolitis, hemorrhaging, and spread of the virus throughout the entire lung. The increase in pathogenicity was not caused by the overproduction of IFN, suggesting the NS1 protein C terminus may interact with PDZ-binding protein(s) and modulate pathogenicity through alternative mechanisms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Blood is a complex tissue comprising numerous cell types with distinct functions and corresponding gene expression profiles. We attempted to define the cell type specific gene expression patterns for the major constituent cells of blood, including B-cells, CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells, lymphocytes and granulocytes. We did this by comparing the global gene expression profiles of purified B-cells, CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells, granulocytes, and lymphocytes using cDNA microarrays. RESULTS: Unsupervised clustering analysis showed that similar cell populations from different donors share common gene expression profiles. Supervised analyses identified gene expression signatures for B-cells (427 genes), T-cells (222 genes), CD8+ T-cells (23 genes), granulocytes (411 genes), and lymphocytes (67 genes). No statistically significant gene expression signature was identified for CD4+ cells. Genes encoding cell surface proteins were disproportionately represented among the genes that distinguished among the lymphocyte subpopulations. Lymphocytes were distinguishable from granulocytes based on their higher levels of expression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, while granulocytes exhibited characteristic expression of various cell surface and inflammatory proteins. CONCLUSION: The genes comprising the cell-type specific signatures encompassed many of the genes already known to be involved in cell-type specific processes, and provided clues that may prove useful in discovering the functions of many still unannotated genes. The most prominent feature of the cell type signature genes was the enrichment of genes encoding cell surface proteins, perhaps reflecting the importance of specialized systems for sensing the environment to the physiology of resting leukocytes.},

abstract = {Background: Tools to visualize and explore genomes hold a central place in genomics and the diversity of genome browsers has increased dramatically over the last few years. It often turns out to be a daunting task to compare and choose a well-adapted genome browser, as multidisciplinary knowledge is required to carry out this task and the number of tools, functionalities and features are overwhelming. Findings: To assist in this task, we propose a community-based framework based on two cornerstones: (i) the implementation of industry promoted software qualification method (QSOS) adapted for genome browser evaluations, and (ii) a web resource providing numerous facilities either for visualizing comparisons or performing new evaluations. We formulated 60 criteria specifically for genome browsers, and incorporated another 65 directly from QSOS's generic section. Those criteria aim to answer versatile needs, ranging from a biologist whose interest primarily lies into user-friendly and informative functionalities, a bioinformatician who wants to integrate the genome browser into a wider framework, or a computer scientist who might choose a software according to more technical features. We developed a dedicated web application to enrich the existing QSOS functionalities (weighting of criteria, user profile) with features of interest to a community-based framework: easy management of evolving data, user comments... Conclusions: The framework is available at http://genome.jouy.inra.fr/CompaGB. It is open to anyone who wishes to participate in the evaluations. It helps the scientific community to (1) choose a genome browser that would better fit their particular project, (2) visualize features comparatively with easily accessible formats, such as tables or radar plots and (3) perform their own evaluation against the defined criteria. To illustrate the CompaGB functionalities, we have evaluated seven genome browsers according to the implemented methodology. A summary of the features of the compared genome browsers is presented and discussed.},

@article{Lee2008b,
abstract = {The advent of microarray technology has made it possible to classify disease states based on gene expression profiles of patients. Typically, marker genes are selected by measuring the power of their expression profiles to discriminate among patients of different disease states. However, expression-based classification can be challenging in complex diseases due to factors such as cellular heterogeneity within a tissue sample and genetic heterogeneity across patients. A promising technique for coping with these challenges is to incorporate pathway information into the disease classification procedure in order to classify disease based on the activity of entire signaling pathways or protein complexes rather than on the expression levels of individual genes or proteins. We propose a new classification method based on pathway activities inferred for each patient. For each pathway, an activity level is summarized from the gene expression levels of its condition-responsive genes (CORGs), defined as the subset of genes in the pathway whose combined expression delivers optimal discriminative power for the disease phenotype. We show that classifiers using pathway activity achieve better performance than classifiers based on individual gene expression, for both simple and complex case-control studies including differentiation of perturbed from non-perturbed cells and subtyping of several different kinds of cancer. Moreover, the new method outperforms several previous approaches that use a static (i.e., non-conditional) definition of pathways. Within a pathway, the identified CORGs may facilitate the development of better diagnostic markers and the discovery of core alterations in human disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus is a major public health concern. Given the lack of effective vaccine and recent evidence of antiviral drug resistance in some isolates, alternative strategies for containment of a possible future pandemic are needed. Humanized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that neutralize H5N1 virus could be used as prophylaxis and treatment to aid in the containment of such a pandemic.

METHODS:Neutralizing mAbs against H5 hemagglutinin were humanized and introduced into C57BL/6 mice (1, 5, or 10 mg/kg bodyweight) one day prior to-, one day post- and three days post-lethal challenge with H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/04 virus. Efficacy was determined by observation of weight loss as well as survival.

RESULTS:Two mAbs neutralizing for antigenically variant H5N1 viruses, A/Vietnam/1203/04 and A/Hong Kong/213/03 were identified and humanized without loss of specificity. Both antibodies exhibited prophylactic efficacy in mice, however, VN04-2-huG1 performed better requiring only 1 mg/kg bodyweight for complete protection. When used to treat infection VN04-2-huG1 was also completely protective, even when introduced three days post infection, although higher dose of antibody was required.

CONCLUSION:Prophylaxis and treatment using neutralizing humanized mAbs is efficacious against lethal challenge with A/Vietnam/1203/04, providing proof of principle for the use of passive antibody therapy as a containment option in the event of pandemic influenza.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND {\&} OBJECTIVES: Since the 2006 massive outbreaks, chikungunya (CHIK) is a major public health concern in India. The aim of this study was to assess envelope specific immune responses in patients with chikungunya infection. METHODS: This study included 46 hospitalized patients with chikungunya virus infection (encephalitis, n=22, other systemic involvement, OSI, n=12, classical, n=12) and six controls from Ahmedabad city, Gujarat, India. T cell responses and the levels of Th1, pro/ anti-inflammatory cytokines against the CHIK virus envelope antigens were assessed by lymphocyte proliferation assay and by cytometric bead array in flow cytometry, respectively. RESULTS: Lymphoproliferative response was uniform among the patients. Comparisons of cytokines revealed significantly higher levels of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5 in encephalitis, OSI and classical patients versus controls. The levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-$\alpha$ were higher in classical patients categories compared to the controls. Interferon (IFN)-$\gamma$ levels were lower in encephalitis patients versus control. INTERPRETATION {\&} CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed recognition of T cell epitopes on the envelope region of chikungunya virus by all patient categories. Lower level of IFN-$\gamma$ may be associated with the severity of disease in these patients.},

abstract = {The rapid spread of dengue is a worldwide public health problem. In two clinical studies of dengue in Managua, Nicaragua, we observed an abrupt increase in disease severity across several epidemic seasons of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) transmission. Waning DENV-1 immunity appeared to increase the risk of severe disease in subsequent DENV-2 infections after a period of cross-protection. The increase in severity coincided with replacement of the Asian/American DENV-2 NI-1 clade with a new virus clade, NI-2B. In vitro analyses of viral isolates from the two clades and analysis of viremia in patient blood samples support the emergence of a fitter virus in later, relative to earlier, epidemic seasons. In addition, the NI-1 clade of viruses was more virulent specifically in children who were immune to DENV-1, whereas DENV-3 immunity was associated with more severe disease among NI-2B infections. Our data demonstrate that the complex interaction between viral genetics and population dynamics of serotype-specific immunity contributes to the risk of severe dengue disease. Furthermore, this work provides insights into viral evolution and the interaction between viral and immunological determinants of viral fitness and virulence.},

abstract = {The HA of influenza virus is a receptor-binding and fusion protein that is required to initiate infection. The HA receptor-binding domain determines the species of sialyl receptors recognized by influenza viruses. Here, we demonstrate that changes in the HA receptor-binding domain alter the ability of the H5N1 virus to spread systemically in mice. The A/Vietnam/1203/04 (VN1203) and A/Hong Kong/213/03 (HK213) viruses are consistently lethal to domestic chickens but differ in their pathogenicity to mammals. Insertion of the VN1203 HA and neuraminidase (NA) genes into recombinant HK213 virus expanded its tissue tropism and increased its lethality in mice; conversely, insertion of HK213 HA and NA genes into recombinant VN1203 virus decreased its systemic spread and lethality. The VN1203 and HK213 HAs differ by 10 aa, and HK213 HA has shown greater binding affinity for synthetic alpha2,6-linked sialyl receptor. Introduction of an S227N change and removal of N-linked glycosylation at residue 158 increased the alpha2,6-binding affinity of VN1203 HA. Recombinant VN1203 virus carrying the S227N change alone or with the residue-158 glycosylation site removed showed reduced lethality and systemic spread in mice but not in domestic chickens. Wild-type VN1203 virus exhibited the greatest efficiency in systemic spread after intramuscular inoculation and in infection of mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and conventional pulmonary dendritic cells. These results show that VN1203 HA glycoprotein confers pathogenicity by facilitating systemic spread in mice; they also suggest that a minor change in receptor binding domain may modulate the virulence of H5N1 viruses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Automatic identification of notifiable diseases from electronic medical records can potentially improve the timeliness and completeness of public health surveillance. We describe the development and implementation of an algorithm for prospective surveillance of patients with acute hepatitis B using electronic medical record data.

METHODS: Initial algorithms were created by adapting Centers for Disease Control and Prevention diagnostic criteria for acute hepatitis B into electronic terms. The algorithms were tested by applying them to ambulatory electronic medical record data spanning 1990 to May 2006. A physician reviewer classified each case identified as acute or chronic infection. Additional criteria were added to algorithms in serial fashion to improve accuracy. The best algorithm was validated by applying it to prospective electronic medical record data from June 2006 through April 2008. Completeness of case capture was assessed by comparison with state health department records.

FINDINGS: A final algorithm including a positive hepatitis B specific test, elevated transaminases and bilirubin, absence of prior positive hepatitis B tests, and absence of an ICD9 code for chronic hepatitis B identified 112/113 patients with acute hepatitis B (sensitivity 97.4{\%}, 95{\%} confidence interval 94-100{\%}; specificity 93.8{\%}, 95{\%} confidence interval 87-100{\%}). Application of this algorithm to prospective electronic medical record data identified 8 cases without false positives. These included 4 patients that had not been reported to the health department. There were no known cases of acute hepatitis B missed by the algorithm.

CONCLUSIONS: An algorithm using codified electronic medical record data can reliably detect acute hepatitis B. The completeness of public health surveillance may be improved by automatically identifying notifiable diseases from electronic medical record data.},

Molecular tests are increasingly used to diagnose C difficile infection (CDI), but many molecular test-positive patients lack toxins that historically defined disease, making it unclear if they need treatment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nObjective: To determine the natural history and need for treatment of patients who are toxin immunoassay negative and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive (Tox-/PCR+) for CDI.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDesign, Setting, and Participants: Prospective observational cohort study at a single academic medical center among 1416 hospitalized adults tested for C difficile toxins 72 hours or longer after admission between December 1, 2010, and October 20, 2012. The analysis was conducted in stages with revisions from April 27, 2013, to January 13, 2015.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMain Outcomes and Measures: Patients undergoing C difficile testing were grouped by US Food and Drug Administration-approved toxin and PCR tests as Tox+/PCR+, Tox-/PCR+, or Tox-/PCR-. Toxin results were reported clinically. Polymerase chain reaction results were not reported. The main study outcomes were duration of diarrhea during up to 14 days of treatment, rate of CDI-related complications (ie, colectomy, megacolon, or intensive care unit care) and CDI-related death within 30 days.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nResults: Twenty-one percent (293 of 1416) of hospitalized adults tested for C difficile were positive by PCR, but 44.7{\%} (131 of 293) had toxins detected by the clinical toxin test. At baseline, Tox-/PCR+ patients had lower C difficile bacterial load and less antibiotic exposure, fecal inflammation, and diarrhea than Tox+/PCR+ patients (P {\textless} .001 for all). The median duration of diarrhea was shorter in Tox-/PCR+ patients (2 days; interquartile range, 1-4 days) than in Tox+/PCR+ patients (3 days; interquartile range, 1-6 days) (P = .003) and was similar to that in Tox-/PCR- patients (2 days; interquartile range, 1-3 days), despite minimal empirical treatment of Tox-/PCR+ patients. No CDI-related complications occurred in Tox-/PCR+ patients vs 10 complications in Tox+/PCR+ patients (0{\%} vs 7.6{\%}, P {\textless} .001). One Tox-/PCR+ patient had recurrent CDI as a contributing factor to death within 30 days vs 11 CDI-related deaths in Tox+/PCR+ patients (0.6{\%} vs 8.4{\%}, P = .001).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nConclusions and Relevance: Among hospitalized adults with suspected CDI, virtually all CDI-related complications and deaths occurred in patients with positive toxin immunoassay test results. Patients with a positive molecular test result and a negative toxin immunoassay test result had outcomes that were comparable to patients without C difficile by either method. Exclusive reliance on molecular tests for CDI diagnosis without tests for toxins or host response is likely to result in overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and increased health care costs.},

The objectives of this review are to: (1) identify public health user needs and preferences for infectious disease information visualization tools; (2) identify existing infectious disease information visualization tools and characterize their architecture and features; (3) identify commonalities among approaches applied to different data types; and (4) describe tool usability evaluation efforts and barriers to the adoption of such tools.

METHODS: We identified articles published in English from January 1, 1980 to June 30, 2013 from five bibliographic databases. Articles with a primary focus on infectious disease visualization tools, needs of public health users, or usability of information visualizations were included in the review.

RESULTS: A total of 88 articles met our inclusion criteria. Users were found to have diverse needs, preferences and uses for infectious disease visualization tools, and the existing tools are correspondingly diverse. The architecture of the tools was inconsistently described, and few tools in the review discussed the incorporation of usability studies or plans for dissemination. Many studies identified concerns regarding data sharing, confidentiality and quality. Existing tools offer a range of features and functions that allow users to explore, analyze, and visualize their data, but the tools are often for siloed applications. Commonly cited barriers to widespread adoption included lack of organizational support, access issues, and misconceptions about tool use.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: As the volume and complexity of infectious disease data increases, public health professionals must synthesize highly disparate data to facilitate communication with the public and inform decisions regarding measures to protect the public's health. Our review identified several themes: consideration of users' needs, preferences, and computer literacy; integration of tools into routine workflow; complications associated with understanding and use of visualizations; and the role of user trust and organizational support in the adoption of these tools. Interoperability also emerged as a prominent theme, highlighting challenges associated with the increasingly collaborative and interdisciplinary nature of infectious disease control and prevention. Future work should address methods for representing uncertainty and missing data to avoid misleading users as well as strategies to minimize cognitive overload.},

It can compute the pairwise genomic distances and a corresponding optimal sorting scenario for an arbitrary number of genomes. All five models can be unified through the DCJ model, thus the implementation is based on DCJ and, where reasonable, uses the most efficient existing algorithms for each distance and sorting problem. Both textual and graphical output is possible for visualizing the operations. Availability and implementation: The software is available through the Bielefeld University Bioinformatics Web Server at http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/dcj with instructions and example data.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the evidence for effects of inpatient antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) on patient, prescribing, and microbial outcomes. DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: Search of MEDLINE (2000 through November 2013), Cochrane Library, and reference lists of relevant studies. We included English language studies with patient populations relevant to the United States (ie, infectious conditions and prescriptions required for antimicrobials) that evaluated ASP interventions and reported outcomes of interest. Study characteristics and outcomes data were extracted and reviewed by investigators and trained research personnel. RESULTS: Few intervention types (eg, audit and feedback, guideline implementation, and decision support) substantially impacted patient outcomes, including mortality, length of stay, readmission, or incidence of Clostridium difficile infection. However, most interventions were not powered adequately to demonstrate impacts on patient outcomes. Most interventions were associated with improved prescribing patterns as measured by decreased antimicrobial use or increased appropriate use. Where reported, ASPs were generally associated with improvements in microbial outcomes, including institutional resistance patterns or resistance in the study population. Few data were provided on harms, sustainability, or key intervention components. Studies were typically of short duration, low in methodological quality, and varied in study design, populations enrolled, hospital setting, ASP intent, intervention composition and implementation, comparison group, and outcomes assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous studies suggest that ASPs can improve prescribing and microbial outcomes. Strength of evidence was low, and most studies were not designed adequately to detect improvements in mortality or other patient outcomes, but obvious adverse effects on patient outcomes were not reported.},

We present an unbiased strategy to systematically perturb candidate regulators and monitor cellular transcriptional responses. We applied this approach to derive regulatory networks that control the transcriptional response of mouse primary dendritic cells to pathogens. Our approach revealed the regulatory functions of 125 transcription factors, chromatin modifiers, and RNA binding proteins, which enabled the construction of a network model consisting of 24 core regulators and 76 fine-tuners that help to explain how pathogen-sensing pathways achieve specificity. This study establishes a broadly applicable, comprehensive, and unbiased approach to reveal the wiring and functions of a regulatory network controlling a major transcriptional response in primary mammalian cells.},

abstract = {Motivation: Genome browsers that support fast navigation through vast datasets and provide interactive visual analytics functions can help scientists achieve deeper insight into biological systems. Toward this end, we developed Integrated Genome Browser (IGB), a highly configurable, interactive and fast open source desktop genome browser. Results: Here we describe multiple updates to IGB, including all-new capabilities to display and interact with data from high-throughput sequencing experiments. To demonstrate, we describe example visualizations and analyses of datasets from RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq and bisulfite sequencing experiments. Understanding results from genome-scale experiments requires viewing the data in the context of reference genome annotations and other related datasets. To facilitate this, we enhanced IGBs ability to consume data from diverse sources, including Galaxy, Distributed Annotation and IGB-specific Quickload servers. To support future visualization needs as new genome-scale assays enter wide use, we transformed the IGB codebase into a modular, extensible platform for developers to create and deploy all-new visualizations of genomic data.

The products of HLA genes interact with surface-specific receptors of T lymphocytes, resulting in activation of the host's immune response. Association of bacterial, viral, parasitic and fungal infections with the host's HLA has been widely investigated. The type and strength of this association differs among distinct populations, as well as among racial and/or ethnic groups. The new molecular methods for the identification of the HLA alleles, and the resulting new nomenclature, have contributed to a better understanding of this system. Unfortunately, this information has not been adequately transmitted to clinicians, which hampers the understanding of the association between the HLA system and diseases. We revised relevant studies on the association of HLA genes with infectious diseases, demonstrating their importance in the pathogenic mechanisms, through increased susceptibility or protection against infections and their complications.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Visualization plays an essential role in genomics research by making it possible to observe correlations and trends in large datasets as well as communicate findings to others. Visual analysis, which combines visualization with analysis tools to enable seamless use of both approaches for scientific investigation, offers a powerful method for performing complex genomic analyses. However, there are numerous challenges that arise when creating rich, interactive Web-based visualizations/visual analysis applications for high-throughput genomics. These challenges include managing data flow from Web server to Web browser, integrating analysis tools and visualizations, and sharing visualizations with colleagues.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We have created a platform simplifies the creation of Web-based visualization/visual analysis applications for high-throughput genomics. This platform provides components that make it simple to efficiently query very large datasets, draw common representations of genomic data, integrate with analysis tools, and share or publish fully interactive visualizations. Using this platform, we have created a Circos-style genome-wide viewer, a generic scatter plot for correlation analysis, an interactive phylogenetic tree, a scalable genome browser for next-generation sequencing data, and an application for systematically exploring tool parameter spaces to find good parameter values. All visualizations are interactive and fully customizable. The platform is integrated with the Galaxy (http://galaxyproject.org) genomics workbench, making it easy to integrate new visual applications into Galaxy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Visualization and visual analysis play an important role in high-throughput genomics experiments, and approaches are needed to make it easier to create applications for these activities. Our framework provides a foundation for creating Web-based visualizations and integrating them into Galaxy. Finally, the visualizations we have created using the framework are useful tools for high-throughput genomics experiments.},

abstract = {CONTEXT Developers of health care software have attributed improvements in patient care to these applications. As with any health care intervention, such claims require confirmation in clinical trials. OBJECTIVES To review controlled trials assessing the effects of computerized clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) and to identify study characteristics predicting benefit. DATA SOURCES We updated our earlier reviews by searching the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Inspec, and ISI databases and consulting reference lists through September 2004. Authors of 64 primary studies confirmed data or provided additional information. STUDY SELECTION We included randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials that evaluated the effect of a CDSS compared with care provided without a CDSS on practitioner performance or patient outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION Teams of 2 reviewers independently abstracted data on methods, setting, CDSS and patient characteristics, and outcomes. DATA SYNTHESIS One hundred studies met our inclusion criteria. The number and methodologic quality of studies improved over time. The CDSS improved practitioner performance in 62 (64{\%}) of the 97 studies assessing this outcome, including 4 (40{\%}) of 10 diagnostic systems, 16 (76{\%}) of 21 reminder systems, 23 (62{\%}) of 37 disease management systems, and 19 (66{\%}) of 29 drug-dosing or prescribing systems. Fifty-two trials assessed 1 or more patient outcomes, of which 7 trials (13{\%}) reported improvements. Improved practitioner performance was associated with CDSSs that automatically prompted users compared with requiring users to activate the system (success in 73{\%} of trials vs 47{\%}; P = .02) and studies in which the authors also developed the CDSS software compared with studies in which the authors were not the developers (74{\%} success vs 28{\%}; respectively, P = .001). CONCLUSIONS Many CDSSs improve practitioner performance. To date, the effects on patient outcomes remain understudied and, when studied, inconsistent.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacterial isolates is essential for clinical diagnosis, to detect emerging problems and to guide empirical treatment. Current phenotypic procedures are sometimes associated with mistakes and may require further genetic testing. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) may soon be within reach even for routine surveillance and clinical diagnostics. The aim of this study was to evaluate WGS as a routine tool for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance compared with current phenotypic procedures.

METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed on 200 isolates originating from Danish pigs, covering four bacterial species. Genomic DNA was purified from all isolates and sequenced as paired-end reads on the Illumina platform. The web servers ResFinder and MLST (www.genomicepidemiology.org) were used to identify acquired antimicrobial resistance genes and MLST types (where MLST stands for multilocus sequence typing). ResFinder results were compared with phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing results using EUCAST epidemiological cut-off values and MLST types.

RESULTS: A total of 3051 different phenotypic tests were performed; 482 led to the categorizing of isolates as resistant and 2569 as susceptible. Seven cases of disagreement between tested and predicted susceptibility were observed, six of which were related to spectinomycin resistance in Escherichia coli. Correlation between MLST type and resistance profiles was only observed in Salmonella Typhimurium, where isolates belonging to sequence type (ST) 34 were more resistant than ST19 isolates.

CONCLUSIONS: High concordance (99.74{\%}) between phenotypic and predicted antimicrobial susceptibility was observed. Thus, antimicrobial resistance testing based on WGS is an alternative to conventional phenotypic methods.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have discovered many genetic loci associated with disease traits, but the functional molecular basis of these associations is often unresolved. Genome-wide regulatory and gene expression profiles measured across individuals and diseases reflect downstream effects of genetic variation and may allow for functional assessment of disease-associated loci. Here, we present a unique approach for systematic integration of genetic disease associations, transcription factor binding among individuals, and gene expression data to assess the functional consequences of variants associated with hundreds of human diseases. In an analysis of genome-wide binding profiles of NF$\kappa$B, we find that disease-associated SNPs are enriched in NF$\kappa$B binding regions overall, and specifically for inflammatory-mediated diseases, such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and coronary artery disease. Using genome-wide variation in transcription factor-binding data, we find that NF$\kappa$B binding is often correlated with disease-associated variants in a genotype-specific and allele-specific manner. Furthermore, we show that this binding variation is often related to expression of nearby genes, which are also found to have altered expression in independent profiling of the variant-associated disease condition. Thus, using this integrative approach, we provide a unique means to assign putative function to many disease-associated SNPs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Twitter has shown some usefulness in predicting influenza cases on a weekly basis in multiple countries and on different geographic scales. Recently, Broniatowski and colleagues suggested Twitter's relevance at the city-level for New York City. Here, we look to dive deeper into the case of New York City by analyzing daily Twitter data from temporal and spatiotemporal perspectives. Also, through manual coding of all tweets, we look to gain qualitative insights that can help direct future automated searches. OBJECTIVE: The intent of the study was first to validate the temporal predictive strength of daily Twitter data for influenza-like illness emergency department (ILI-ED) visits during the New York City 2012-2013 influenza season against other available and established datasets (Google search query, or GSQ), and second, to examine the spatial distribution and the spread of geocoded tweets as proxies for potential cases. METHODS: From the Twitter Streaming API, 2972 tweets were collected in the New York City region matching the keywords "flu", "influenza", "gripe", and "high fever". The tweets were categorized according to the scheme developed by Lamb et al. A new fourth category was added as an evaluator guess for the probability of the subject(s) being sick to account for strength of confidence in the validity of the statement. Temporal correlations were made for tweets against daily ILI-ED visits and daily GSQ volume. The best models were used for linear regression for forecasting ILI visits. A weighted, retrospective Poisson model with SaTScan software (n=1484), and vector map were used for spatiotemporal analysis. RESULTS: Infection-related tweets (R=.763) correlated better than GSQ time series (R=.683) for the same keywords and had a lower mean average percent error (8.4 vs 11.8) for ILI-ED visit prediction in January, the most volatile month of flu. SaTScan identified primary outbreak cluster of high-probability infection tweets with a 2.74 relative risk ratio compared to medium-probability infection tweets at P=.001 in Northern Brooklyn, in a radius that includes Barclay's Center and the Atlantic Avenue Terminal. CONCLUSIONS: While others have looked at weekly regional tweets, this study is the first to stress test Twitter for daily city-level data for New York City. Extraction of personal testimonies of infection-related tweets suggests Twitter's strength both qualitatively and quantitatively for ILI-ED prediction compared to alternative daily datasets mixed with awareness-based data such as GSQ. Additionally, granular Twitter data provide important spatiotemporal insights. A tweet vector-map may be useful for visualization of city-level spread when local gold standard data are otherwise unavailable.},

We found that IL-6 and IFN-alpha levels in nasal lavage fluids peaked early (day 2) and correlated directly with viral titers, temperature, mucus production, and symptom scores. IL-6 elevations were also found in the circulation at this time point. In contrast, TNF-alpha responses peaked later (day 3 in plasma, day 4 in nasal fluids), when viral shedding and symptoms were subsiding. Similarly, IL-8 peaked late in the illness course (days 4-6) and correlated only with lower respiratory symptoms, which also occurred late. None of IL-1beta, IL-2, or TGF-beta levels increased significantly. These data implicate IL-6 and IFN-alpha as key factors both in symptom formation and host defense in influenza.},

@article{Miotto2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is widespread concern that H5N1 avian influenza A viruses will emerge as a pandemic threat, if they become capable of human-to-human (H2H) transmission. Avian strains lack this capability, which suggests that it requires important adaptive mutations. We performed a large-scale comparative analysis of proteins from avian and human strains, to produce a catalogue of mutations associated with H2H transmissibility, and to detect their presence in avian isolates. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We constructed a dataset of influenza A protein sequences from 92,343 public database records. Human and avian sequence subsets were compared, using a method based on mutual information, to identify characteristic sites where human isolates present conserved mutations. The resulting catalogue comprises 68 characteristic sites in eight internal proteins. Subtype variability prevented the identification of adaptive mutations in the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins. The high number of sites in the ribonucleoprotein complex suggests interdependence between mutations in multiple proteins. Characteristic sites are often clustered within known functional regions, suggesting their functional roles in cellular processes. By isolating and concatenating characteristic site residues, we defined adaptation signatures, which summarize the adaptive potential of specific isolates. Most adaptive mutations emerged within three decades after the 1918 pandemic, and have remained remarkably stable thereafter. Two lineages with stable internal protein constellations have circulated among humans without reassorting. On the contrary, H5N1 avian and swine viruses reassort frequently, causing both gains and losses of adaptive mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Human host adaptation appears to be complex and systemic, involving nearly all influenza proteins. Adaptation signatures suggest that the ability of H5N1 strains to infect humans is related to the presence of an unusually high number of adaptive mutations. However, these mutations appear unstable, suggesting low pandemic potential of H5N1 in its current form. In addition, adaptation signatures indicate that pandemic H1N1/09 strain possesses multiple human-transmissibility mutations, though not an unusually high number with respect to swine strains that infected humans in the past. Adaptation signatures provide a novel tool for identifying zoonotic strains with the potential to infect humans.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the primary objectives in cancer research is to identify causal genomic alterations, such as somatic copy number variation (CNV) and somatic mutations, during tumor development. Many valuable studies lack genomic data to detect CNV; therefore, methods that are able to infer CNVs from gene expression data would help maximize the value of these studies.

RESULTS: We developed a framework for identifying recurrent regions of CNV and distinguishing the cancer driver genes from the passenger genes in the regions. By inferring CNV regions across many datasets we were able to identify 109 recurrent amplified/deleted CNV regions. Many of these regions are enriched for genes involved in many important processes associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Genes in these recurrent CNV regions were then examined in the context of gene regulatory networks to prioritize putative cancer driver genes. The cancer driver genes uncovered by the framework include not only well-known oncogenes but also a number of novel cancer susceptibility genes validated via siRNA experiments.

CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first effort to systematically identify and validate drivers for expression based CNV regions in breast cancer. The framework where the wavelet analysis of copy number alteration based on expression coupled with the gene regulatory network analysis, provides a blueprint for leveraging genomic data to identify key regulatory components and gene targets. This integrative approach can be applied to many other large-scale gene expression studies and other novel types of cancer data such as next-generation sequencing based expression (RNA-Seq) as well as CNV data.},

@article{Sandbulte2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND:A pandemic H5N1 influenza outbreak would be facilitated by an absence of immunity to the avian-derived virus in the human population. Although this condition is likely in regard to hemagglutinin-mediated immunity, the neuraminidase (NA) of H5N1 viruses (avN1) and of endemic human H1N1 viruses (huN1) are classified in the same serotype. We hypothesized that an immune response to huN1 could mediate cross-protection against H5N1 influenza virus infection.

METHODS AND FINDINGS:Mice were immunized against the NA of a contemporary human H1N1 strain by DNA vaccination. They were challenged with recombinant A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) viruses bearing huN1 (PR8-huN1) or avN1 (PR8-avN1) or with H5N1 virus A/Vietnam/1203/04. Additional na{\"{i}}ve mice were injected with sera from vaccinated mice prior to H5N1 challenge. Also, serum specimens from humans were analyzed for reactivity with avN1. Immunization elicited a serum IgG response to huN1 and robust protection against the homologous challenge virus. Immunized mice were partially protected from lethal challenge with H5N1 virus or recombinant PR8-avN1. Sera transferred from immunized mice to na{\"{i}}ve animals conferred similar protection against H5N1 mortality. Analysis of human sera showed that antibodies able to inhibit the sialidase activity of avN1 exist in some individuals.

CONCLUSIONS:These data reveal that humoral immunity elicited by huN1 can partially protect against H5N1 infection in a mammalian host. Our results suggest that a portion of the human population could have some degree of resistance to H5N1 influenza, with the possibility that this could be induced or enhanced through immunization with seasonal influenza vaccines.},

abstract = {DNA microarrays and specific reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays were used to reveal transcriptional patterns in the blood of children presenting with dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and well-matched patients with uncomplicated dengue. The transcriptome of patients with acute uncomplicated dengue was characterized by a metabolically demanding "host-defense" profile; transcripts related to oxidative metabolism, interferon signaling, protein ubiquination, apoptosis, and cytokines were prominent. In contrast, the transcriptome of patients with DSS was surprisingly benign, particularly with regard to transcripts derived from apoptotic and type I interferon pathways. These data highlight significant heterogeneity in the type or timing of host transcriptional immune responses precipitated by dengue virus infection independent of the duration of illness. In particular, they suggest that, if transcriptional events in the blood compartment contribute to capillary leakage leading to hypovolemic shock, they occur before cardiovascular decompensation, a finding that has implications for rational adjuvant therapy in this syndrome.},

abstract = {Gene expression data generated systematically in a given system over multiple time points provides a source of perturbation that can be leveraged to infer causal relationships among genes explaining network changes. Previously, we showed that food intake has a large impact on blood gene expression patterns and that these responses, either in terms of gene expression level or gene-gene connectivity, are strongly associated with metabolic diseases. In this study, we explored which genes drive the changes of gene expression patterns in response to time and food intake. We applied the Granger causality test and the dynamic Bayesian network to gene expression data generated from blood samples collected at multiple time points during the course of a day. The simulation result shows that combining many short time series together is as powerful to infer Granger causality as using a single long time series. Using the Granger causality test, we identified genes that were supported as the most likely causal candidates for the coordinated temporal changes in the network. These results show that PER1 is a key regulator of the blood transcriptional network, in which multiple biological processes are under circadian rhythm regulation. The fasted and fed dynamic Bayesian networks showed that over 72{\%} of dynamic connections are self links. Finally, we show that different processes such as inflammation and lipid metabolism, which are disconnected in the static network, become dynamically linked in response to food intake, which would suggest that increasing nutritional load leads to coordinate regulation of these biological processes. In conclusion, our results suggest that food intake has a profound impact on the dynamic co-regulation of multiple biological processes, such as metabolism, immune response, apoptosis and circadian rhythm. The results could have broader implications for the design of studies of disease association and drug response in clinical trials.},

abstract = {A total of 57 clinical isolates were screened by disk diffusion for a related pharmacodynamic study. Testing was performed using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines, except that results were interpreted at 16 to 18 h and 48 h. Of the 57 isolates, 19 were randomly chosen for additional comparative susceptibility testing of five methods (disk diffusion, Etest, Alamar colorimetric broth microdilution, Vitek, and MicroScan) and an in-house broth microdilution method. The two diffusion methods (disk and Etest) had the closest correlation. The commercial broth microdilution methods and the in-house microdilution method generated inconsistent results for all agents except trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Vitek compared poorly with both diffusion and microbroth dilution methods. The most significant discrepancies were evident with all methods when the incubation period was extended to 48 h. When results were interpreted at 48 h, the incidence of resistance for all bactericidal agents was approximately double the resistance observed at 16 to 18 h. The bacteriostatic agents, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and doxycycline, demonstrated the greatest in vitro activity and were least influenced by extended incubation with diffusion methods. Because correlative in vivo and in vitro studies have not revealed an effective therapeutic regimen for serious S. maltophilia infections, susceptibility results with all testing methods should be interpreted with caution when choosing therapy for patients with life-threatening infections. Susceptibility testing for this heterogeneous group remains controversial and routine testing, with the possible exception of doxycycline (or minocycline) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, should be avoided. Our data support that if testing is done with bactericidal agents, consideration should be given to interpretation after 48-h incubation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In recent years, the number of human infections caused by opportunistic pathogens has increased dramatically. Plant rhizospheres are one of the most typical natural reservoirs for these pathogens but they also represent a great source for beneficial microbes with potential for biotechnological applications. However, understanding the natural variation and possible differences between pathogens and beneficials is the main challenge in furthering these possibilities. The genus Stenotrophomonas contains representatives found to be associated with human and plant host.

RESULTS: We used comparative genomics as well as transcriptomic and physiological approaches to detect significant borders between the Stenotrophomonas strains: the multi-drug resistant pathogenic S. maltophilia and the plant-associated strains S. maltophilia R551-3 and S. rhizophila DSM14405T (both are biocontrol agents). We found an overall high degree of sequence similarity between the genomes of all three strains. Despite the notable similarity in potential factors responsible for host invasion and antibiotic resistance, other factors including several crucial virulence factors and heat shock proteins were absent in the plant-associated DSM14405T. Instead, S. rhizophila DSM14405T possessed unique genes for the synthesis and transport of the plant-protective spermidine, plant cell-wall degrading enzymes, and high salinity tolerance. Moreover, the presence or absence of bacterial growth at 37°C was identified as a very simple method in differentiating between pathogenic and non-pathogenic isolates. DSM14405T is not able to grow at this human-relevant temperature, most likely in great part due to the absence of heat shock genes and perhaps also because of the up-regulation at increased temperatures of several genes involved in a suicide mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS: While this study is important for understanding the mechanisms behind the emerging pattern of infectious diseases, it is, to our knowledge, the first of its kind to assess the risk of beneficial strains for biotechnological applications. We identified certain traits typical of pathogens such as growth at the human body temperature together with the production of heat shock proteins as opposed to a temperature-regulated suicide system that is harnessed by beneficials.},

In the present study 198 clinical isolates, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 146), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 25), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 27) were evaluated. Reference susceptibility testing of cefepime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, meropenem, piperacillin, tobramycin, levofloxacin (only for P. aeruginosa), co-trimoxazole (only for S. maltophilia), and ampicillin-sulbactam and tetracycline (only for A. baumannii) was performed by microdilution (NCCLS guidelines). The VITEK 2 system correctly identified 91.6, 100, and 76{\%} of P. aeruginosa, S. maltophilia, and A. baumannii isolates, respectively, within 3 h. The respective percentages of essential agreement (to within 1 twofold dilution) for P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii were 89.0 and 88.0{\%} (cefepime), 91.1 and 100{\%} (cefotaxime), 95.2 and 96.0{\%} (ceftazidime), 98.6 and 100{\%} (ciprofloxacin), 88.4 and 100{\%} (gentamicin), 87.0 and 92.0{\%} (imipenem), 85.0 and 88.0{\%} (meropenem), 84.2 and 96.0{\%} (piperacillin), and 97.3 and 80{\%} (tobramycin). The essential agreement for levofloxacin against P. aeruginosa was 86.3{\%}. The percentages of essential agreement for ampicillin-sulbactam and tetracycline against A. baumannii were 88.0 and 100{\%}, respectively. Very major errors for P. aeruginosa (resistant by the reference method, susceptible with the VITEK 2 system [resistant to susceptible]) were noted for cefepime (0.7{\%}), cefotaxime (0.7{\%}), gentamicin (0.7{\%}), imipenem (1.4{\%}), levofloxacin (2.7{\%}), and piperacillin (2.7{\%}) and, for one strain of A. baumannii, for imipenem. Major errors (susceptible to resistant) were noted only for P. aeruginosa and cefepime (2.0{\%}), ceftazidime (0.7{\%}), and piperacillin (3.4{\%}). Minor errors ranged from 0.0{\%} for piperacillin to 22.6{\%} for cefotaxime against P. aeruginosa and from 0.0{\%} for piperacillin and ciprofloxacin to 20.0{\%} for cefepime against A. baumannii. The VITEK 2 system provided co-trimoxazole MICs only for S. maltophilia; no very major or major errors were obtained for co-trimoxazole against this species. It is concluded that the VITEK 2 system allows the rapid identification of S. maltophilia and most P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates. The VITEK 2 system can perform reliable susceptibility testing of many of the antimicrobial agents used against P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. It would be desirable if new versions of the VITEK 2 software were able to determine MICs and the corresponding clinical categories of agents active against S. maltophilia.},

abstract = {Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging multidrug-resistant global opportunistic pathogen. The increasing incidence of nosocomial and community-acquired S. maltophilia infections is of particular concern for immunocompromised individuals, as this bacterial pathogen is associated with a significant fatality/case ratio. S. maltophilia is an environmental bacterium found in aqueous habitats, including plant rhizospheres, animals, foods, and water sources. Infections of S. maltophilia can occur in a range of organs and tissues; the organism is commonly found in respiratory tract infections. This review summarizes the current literature and presents S. maltophilia as an organism with various molecular mechanisms used for colonization and infection. S. maltophilia can be recovered from polymicrobial infections, most notably from the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis patients, as a cocolonizer with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Recent evidence of cell-cell communication between these pathogens has implications for the development of novel pharmacological therapies. Animal models of S. maltophilia infection have provided useful information about the type of host immune response induced by this opportunistic pathogen. Current and emerging treatments for patients infected with S. maltophilia are discussed.},

abstract = {Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has emerged in recent years as a paradigm of an intrinsically resistant, opportunistic bacterial pathogen with an environmental origin. The recent publication of the sequences of two S. maltophilia genomes has shown that this bacterium contains a large repertoire of antibiotic resistance determinants, probably contributing to its characteristic susceptibility to antibiotics. Among those determinants, the best characterized are a number of multidrug efflux pumps, beta-lactamases and aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes. Recently, the presence of a gene coding for a Qnr determinant in the genome of S. maltophilia has also been described. Together, these elements confer resistance to several of the drugs currently used for treating infections. Besides these chromosomally encoded determinants, which evolved in S. maltophilia long before the recent human use of antibiotics, this bacterial species is acquiring novel resistance genes by horizontal gene transfer, thereby increasing its resistance. Future studies are required to fully understand the mechanisms of resistance, their regulation and potential crosstalk with S. maltophilia virulence, as well as the population dynamics of the different isolates of this bacterial species.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The rise of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria is a significant problem for the treatment of infectious diseases. Resistance is usually selected by the antibiotic itself; however, biocides might also co-select for resistance to antibiotics. Although resistance to biocides is poorly defined, different in vitro studies have shown that mutants presenting low susceptibility to biocides also have reduced susceptibility to antibiotics. However, studies with natural bacterial isolates are more limited and there are no clear conclusions as to whether the use of biocides results in the development of multidrug resistant bacteria.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The main goal is to perform an unbiased blind-based evaluation of the relationship between antibiotic and biocide reduced susceptibility in natural isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. One of the largest data sets ever studied comprising 1632 human clinical isolates of S. aureus originated worldwide was analysed. The phenotypic characterization of 13 antibiotics and 4 biocides was performed for all the strains. Complex links between reduced susceptibility to biocides and antibiotics are difficult to elucidate using the standard statistical approaches in phenotypic data. Therefore, machine learning techniques were applied to explore the data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In this pioneer study, we demonstrated that reduced susceptibility to two common biocides, chlorhexidine and benzalkonium chloride, which belong to different structural families, is associated to multidrug resistance. We have consistently found that a minimum inhibitory concentration greater than 2 mg/L for both biocides is related to antibiotic non-susceptibility in S. aureus.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Two important results emerged from our work, one methodological and one other with relevance in the field of antibiotic resistance. We could not conclude on whether the use of antibiotics selects for biocide resistance or vice versa. However, the observation of association between multiple resistance and two biocides commonly used may be of concern for the treatment of infectious diseases in the future.},

abstract = {Accurate determination of resistance is important to ensure appropriate antimicrobial therapy in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections. This study was undertaken to evaluate the susceptibility results obtained by disc diffusion, E-test, Phoenix system, and reference agar dilution method and also to evaluate the in vitro activity of various antimicrobial combinations against multidrug-resistant S. maltophilia. Susceptibilities to several antimicrobial agents were determined by agar dilution, disc diffusion, and E-test according to the US Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Results were also evaluated in the in Phoenix system for available agents. Twelve different antibiotic combinations were tested for synergy by the E-test method. Most synergic combinations were confirmed by microdilution checkerboard assay. Tigecycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and doxycycline were the most effective drugs against S. maltophilia. Poorest agreement was determined by disc diffusion and E-test against ticarcillin/clavulanate and ciprofloxacin ($\kappa$ {\textless} 0.4), by disc diffusion against colistin ($\kappa$ {\textless} 0.4), and by the Phoenix system against piperacillin/tazobactam ($\kappa$ {\textless} 0.4). Based on these data, disc diffusion seems to be unreliable for ticarcillin/clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, and colistin; E-test for ticarcillin/clavulanate and ciprofloxacin; and the Phoenix system for piperacillin/tazobactam for S. maltophilia susceptibility testing. Synergistic activity was detected predominantly with TMP-SMX + ticarcillin/clavulanate and TMP-SMX + ceftazidime. TMP-SMX + ceftazidime synergy was also supported by the checkerboard method. However, TMP-SMX + ticarcillin/clavulanate combination revealed indifferent effect by the checkerboard assay. As ticarcillin/clavulanate and ciprofloxacin E-test results were beyond the acceptable correlation limits, synergy testing performed with these agents was considered as unreliable. Further studies are required to standardize susceptibility testing, especially for colistin, ticarcillin/clavulanate, and ciprofloxacin for S. maltophilia. TMP-SMX-containing drug combinations seemed to be more synergistic on multidrug-resistant S. maltophilia; however, these results merit further evaluation.},

abstract = {Bacterial plasmids encode resistance systems for toxic metal ions including Ag+, AsO2-, AsO4(3-), Cd2+, CO2+, CrO4(2-), Cu2+, Hg2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Sb3+, TeO3(2-), Tl+, and Zn2+. In addition to understanding of the molecular genetics and environmental roles of these resistances, studies during the last few years have provided surprises and new biochemical mechanisms. Chromosomal determinants of toxic metal resistances are known, and the distinction between plasmid resistances and those from chromosomal genes has blurred, because for some metals (notably mercury and arsenic), the plasmid and chromosomal determinants are basically the same. Other systems, such as copper transport ATPases and metallothionein cation-binding proteins, are only known from chromosomal genes. The largest group of metal resistance systems function by energy-dependent efflux of toxic ions. Some of the efflux systems are ATPases and others are chemiosmotic cation/proton antiporters. The CadA cadmium resistance ATPase of gram-positive bacteria and the CopB copper efflux system of Enterococcus hirae are homologous to P-type ATPases of animals and plants. The CadA ATPase protein has been labeled with 32P from gamma-32P-ATP and drives ATP-dependent Cd2+ uptake by inside-out membrane vesicles. Recently isolated genes defective in the human hereditary diseases of copper metabolism, Menkes syndrome and Wilson's disease, encode P-type ATPases that are more similar to the bacterial CadA and CopB ATPases than to eukaryote ATPases that pump different cations. The arsenic resistance efflux system transports arsenite, using alternatively either a two-component (ArsA and ArsB) ATPase or a single polypeptide (ArsB) functioning as a chemiosmotic transporter. The third gene in the arsenic resistance system, arsC, encodes an enzyme that converts intracellular arsenate [As (V)] to arsenite [As (III)], the substrate of the efflux system. The three-component Czc (Cd2+, Zn2+, and CO2+) chemiosmotic efflux pump of soil microbes consists of inner membrane (CzcA), outer membrane (CzcC), and membrane-spanning (CzcB) proteins that together transport cations from the cytoplasm across the periplasmic space to the outside of the cell. Finally, the first bacterial metallothionein (which by definition is a small protein that binds metal cations by means of numerous cysteine thiolates) has been characterized in cyanobacteria.},

Previous studies have proved a 3D dynamic simulated microgravity (SMG) culture system as a "stimulatory" environment for the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells. Here, we employed the NASA-approved rotary bioreactor to investigate the proliferation and differentiation of human epidermal stem cells (hEpSCs). hEpSCs were isolated from children foreskins and enriched by collecting epidermal stem cell colonies. Cytodex-3 micro-carriers and hEpSCs were co-cultured in the rotary bioreactor and 6-well dish for 15 days. The result showed that hEpSCs cultured in rotary bioreactor exhibited enhanced proliferation and viability surpassing those cultured in static conditions. Additionally, immunostaining analysis confirmed higher percentage of ki67 positive cells in rotary bioreactor compared with the static culture. In contrast, comparing with static culture, cells in the rotary bioreactor displayed a low expression of involucrin at day 10. Histological analysis revealed that cells cultured in rotary bioreactor aggregated on the micro-carriers and formed multilayer 3D epidermis structures. In conclusion, our research suggests that NASA-approved rotary bioreactor can support the proliferation of hEpSCs and provide a strategy to form multilayer epidermis structure.},

Since biofilm formation in space is well documented and planktonic cells become more resistant and virulent under modeled microgravity, it is important to determine the effect of this gravity condition on biofilms. Inclusion of glass microcarrier beads of appropriate dimensions and density with medium and inoculum, in vessels specially designed to permit ground-based investigations into aspects of low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG), facilitated these studies. Mathematical modeling of microcarrier behavior based on experimental conditions demonstrated that they satisfied the criteria for LSMMG conditions. Experimental observations confirmed that the microcarrier trajectory in the LSMMG vessel concurred with the predicted model. At 24 h, the LSMMG Escherichia coli biofilms were thicker than their normal-gravity counterparts and exhibited increased resistance to the general stressors salt and ethanol and to two antibiotics (penicillin and chloramphenicol). Biofilms of a mutant of E. coli, deficient in sigma(s), were impaired in developing LSMMG-conferred resistance to the general stressors but not to the antibiotics, indicating two separate pathways of LSMMG-conferred resistance.},

The principal aim of this review is to highlight the advances and accomplishments in the field of tissue engineering that could be achieved by culturing cells in Space or by devices created to simulate microgravity on Earth. Understanding the biology of three-dimensional (3D) multicellular structures is very important for a more complete appreciation of in vivo tissue function and advancing in vitro tissue engineering efforts. Various cells exposed to r-$\mu$g in Space or to s-$\mu$g created by a random positioning machine, a 2D-clinostat, or a rotating wall vessel bioreactor grew in the form of 3D tissues. Hence, these methods represent a new strategy for tissue engineering of a variety of tissues, such as regenerated cartilage, artificial vessel constructs, and other organ tissues as well as multicellular cancer spheroids. These aggregates are used to study molecular mechanisms involved in angiogenesis, cancer development, and biology and for pharmacological testing of, for example, chemotherapeutic drugs or inhibitors of neoangiogenesis. Moreover, they are useful for studying multicellular responses in toxicology and radiation biology, or for performing coculture experiments. The future will show whether these tissue-engineered constructs can be used for medical transplantations. Unveiling the mechanisms of microgravity-dependent molecular and cellular changes is an up-to-date requirement for improving Space medicine and developing new treatment strategies that can be translated to in vivo models while reducing the use of laboratory animals.},

abstract = {Due to its avascular nature, articular cartilage exhibits a very limited capacity to regenerate and to repair. Although much of the tissue-engineered cartilage in existence has been successful in mimicking the morphological and biochemical appearance of hyaline cartilage, it is generally mechanically inferior to the natural tissue. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the application of dynamic deformational loading at physiological strain levels enhances chondrocyte matrix elaboration in cell-seeded agarose scaffolds to produce a more functional engineered tissue construct than in free swelling controls. A custom-designed bioreactor was used to load cell-seeded agarose disks dynamically in unconfined compression with a peak-to-peak compressive strain amplitude of 10 percent, at a frequency of 1 Hz, 3 x (1 hour on, 1 hour off)/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks. Results demonstrated that dynamically loaded disks yielded a sixfold increase in the equilibrium aggregate modulus over free swelling controls after 28 days of loading (100 +/- 16 kPa versus 15 +/- 8 kPa, p {\textless} 0.0001). This represented a 21-fold increase over the equilibrium modulus of day 0 (4.8 +/- 2.3 kPa). Sulfated glycosaminoglycan content and hydroxyproline content was also found to be greater in dynamically loaded disks compared to free swelling controls at day 21 (p {\textless} 0.0001 and p = 0.002, respectively).},

abstract = {Mechanical stimulation may be used to enhance the development of engineered constructs for the replacement of load bearing tissues, such as the intervertebral disc. This study examined the effects of dynamic hydrostatic pressure (HP) on outer and inner annulus (OA, IA) fibrosus cells seeded on fibrous poly(glycolic acid)-poly(L-lactic acid) scaffolds. Constructs were pressurized (5 MPa, 0.5 Hz) for 4 h/day from day 3 to day 14 of culture and analyzed using ELISAs and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assess extracellular matrix (ECM) production. Both cell types were viable, with OA cells exhibiting more infiltration into the scaffold, which was enhanced by HP. ELISA analyses revealed that HP had no effect on type I collagen production while a significant increase in type II collagen (COL II) was measured in pressurized OA constructs compared to day 14 unloaded controls. Both OA and IA dynamically loaded scaffolds exhibited more uniform COL II elaboration as shown by IHC analyses, which was most pronounced in OA-seeded scaffolds. Overall, HP resulted in enhanced ECM elaboration and organization by OA-seeded constructs, while IA-seeded scaffolds were less responsive. As such, hydrostatic pressurization may be beneficial in annulus fibrosus tissue engineering when applied in concert with an appropriate cell source and scaffold material.},

abstract = {This study explored the biologic response of chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to a dynamic mechanical loading regime. We developed a time-efficient methodology for monitoring regional changes in extracellular matrix gene transcription using reporter promoter constructs. Specifically, transfected cells were homogenously distributed throughout agarose hydrogel constructs, and spatial and temporal gene expression and the ability to form functional ECM were analyzed in response to dynamic mechanical stimuli. Theoretical analyses were used to predict the physical signals generated within the gel in response to these loading regimes. Using a custom compression bioreactor system, changes in aggrecan and type II collagen promoter activity in transfected chondrocyte-laden cylindrical constructs were evaluated in response to a range of loading frequencies and durations. In general, aggrecan promoter activity increased with increasing duration of loading, particularly in the outer annulus region. Interestingly, type II collagen promoter activity decreased in this annular region under identical loading conditions. In addition, we explored the role of mechanical compression in directing chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs by monitoring short-term aggrecan promoter activity. As an example of long-term utility, a specific loading protocol was applied to MSC-laden constructs for 5 days, and the resultant changes in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) production were evaluated over a 4-week period. This dynamic loading regime increased not only short-term aggrecan transcriptional activity but also GAG deposition in long-term culture. These results demonstrate the utility of a new reporter promoter system for optimizing loading protocols to improve the outcome of engineered chondrocyte- and MSC-laden cartilaginous constructs.},

abstract = {Low back pain is a common and debilitating disorder. Current evidence implicates intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration and herniation as major causes, although the pathogenesis is poorly understood. While several cytokines have been implicated in the process of IVD degeneration and herniation, investigations have predominately focused on Interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). However, to date no studies have investigated the expression of these cytokines simultaneously in IVD degeneration or herniation, or determined which may be the predominant cytokine associated with these disease states. Using quantitative real time PCR and immunohistochemistry we investigated gene and protein expression for IL-1beta, TNFalpha and their receptors in non-degenerate, degenerate and herniated human IVDs. IL-1beta gene expression was observed in a greater proportion of IVDs than TNFalpha (79{\%} versus 59{\%}). Degenerate and herniated IVDs displayed higher levels of both cytokines than non-degenerate IVDs, although in degenerate IVDs higher levels of IL-1beta gene expression (1,300 copies/100 ng cDNA) were observed compared to those of TNFalpha (250 copies of TNFalpha/100 ng cDNA). Degenerate IVDs showed ten-fold higher IL-1 receptor gene expression compared to non-degenerate IVDs. In addition, 80{\%} of degenerate IVD cells displayed IL-1 receptor immunopositivity compared to only 30{\%} of cells in non-degenerate IVDs. However, no increase in TNF receptor I gene or protein expression was observed in degenerate or herniated IVDs compared to non-degenerate IVDs. We have demonstrated that although both cytokines are produced by human IVD cells, IL-1beta is expressed at higher levels and in more IVDs, particularly in more degenerate IVDs (grades 4 to 12). Importantly, this study has highlighted an increase in gene and protein production for the IL-1 receptor type I but not the TNF receptor type I in degenerate IVDs. The data thus suggest that although both cytokines may be involved in the pathogenesis of IVD degeneration, IL-1 may have a more significant role than TNFalpha, and thus may be a better target for therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {The maintenance of the intervertebral disc extracellular matrix is regulated by mechanical loading, nutrition, and the accumulation of matrix proteins and cytokines that are affected by both aging and degeneration. Evidence suggests that cellular aging may lead to alterations in the quantity and quality of extracellular matrix produced. The aims of this study were to examine the role of loading and maturation (a subset of aging), and the interaction between these two factors in intervertebral disc cell gene expression and biosynthesis in a controlled 3D culture environment. Cells were isolated from young (4-6 months) and mature (18-24 months) bovine caudal annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus tissue. Isolated cells were seeded into alginate and dynamically compressed for 7 days at either 0.1, 1, or 3 Hz or maintained as a free-swelling control. After 7 days, DNA and sulfated glycosaminoglycan contents were analyzed along with real time, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis for collagen types I and II, aggrecan, and matrix metalloproteinase-3 gene expression. Results suggest that maturation plays an important role in intervertebral disc homeostasis and influences the cell response to mechanical loading. While isolated intervertebral disc cells responded to mechanical compression in 3D culture, the effect of loading frequency was minimal. Altered cellular phenotype and biosynthesis rates appear to be an attribute of the cell maturation process, potentially independent of changes in cellular microenvironment associated with lost nutrition and disc degeneration. Mature cells may have a decreased capacity to create or retain extracellular matrix components in response to mechanical loading compared to young cells.},

abstract = {The pathogenesis of vibration-induced disorders of intervertebral disc at the cellular level is largely unknown. Dynamic loads with frequencies close to that of the in vivo human spine resonant frequency (4-6 Hz) have a destructive effect, which may induce extracellular disc matrix (ECM) degradation. To investigate this issue, three-dimensional (3D) alginate cultures of normal pig intervertebral disc nucleus and inner annulus cells were tested under dynamic hydrostatic loading. Alginate cultures of each region were divided into six groups; five groups were exposed to cyclic hydrostatic pressures of frequencies 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 Hz with the same amplitude (1 MPa), and group 6 was the control group (no loading). Cultures of different groups were loaded for 3 days (30 min daily) in a hydraulic chamber. Effects of loading frequency on disc collagen and protein metabolism were investigated by measuring 3H-proline-labeled proteins associated with the cells in the extracellular matrix and release of 3H-proline-labeled molecules into culture medium. The results indicated a poor synthesis rate and more degradation near the 5 Hz frequency. The repeatability of experiments was verified by performing two experiments with the same protocol. Both experiments indicated that a threshold frequency of around 5 Hz disrupted protein metabolism.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A number of in vitro models of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) have been developed to study the effect of mechanical overload on the processes that regulate cartilage degeneration. While such frameworks are critical for the identification therapeutic targets, existing technologies are limited in their throughput capacity. Here, we validate a test platform for high-throughput mechanical injury incorporating engineered cartilage.

METHOD: We utilized a high-throughput mechanical testing platform to apply injurious compression to engineered cartilage and determined their strain and strain rate dependent responses to injury. Next, we validated this response by applying the same injury conditions to cartilage explants. Finally, we conducted a pilot screen of putative PTOA therapeutic compounds.

RESULTS: Engineered cartilage response to injury was strain dependent, with a 2-fold increase in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) loss at 75{\%} compared to 50{\%} strain. Extensive cell death was observed adjacent to fissures, with membrane rupture corroborated by marked increases in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Testing of established PTOA therapeutics showed that pan-caspase inhibitor [Z-VAD-FMK (ZVF)] was effective at reducing cell death, while the amphiphilic polymer [Poloxamer 188 (P188)] and the free-radical scavenger [N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC)] reduced GAG loss as compared to injury alone.

CONCLUSIONS: The injury response in this engineered cartilage model replicated key features of the response of cartilage explants, validating this system for application of physiologically relevant injurious compression. This study establishes a novel tool for the discovery of mechanisms governing cartilage injury, as well as a screening platform for the identification of new molecules for the treatment of PTOA.},

abstract = {Mechanical loading of the intervertebral disc (IVD) plays an important role in governing the function of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. In situ, the loading environment of the NP is neither fully confined nor unconfined. To investigate the potential influences of these idealized loading modes, we utilized an alginate cell culture system to compare the effects of 1 h confined and unconfined compression on glycoprotein gene expression in mixed population NP cells. For dynamic compression, we applied 10 kPa peak stress using a sinusoidal waveform at 0.5 Hz. For static compression, displacements were applied at a constant rate and held at 20{\%} strain. Aggrecan, laminin, fibronectin, glypican, biglycan, and fibromodulin were generally stimulated, and trends were similar between confined and unconfined compression. On the other hand, lumican expression was differentially regulated between confined and unconfined groups. More interestingly, trends under static loading were opposite that under dynamic loading; lumican was upregulated in static confined compression and in dynamic unconfined compression. We theorize that this pattern is indicative of regulation by fluid flow within loaded alginate disks. Calculations using the linear biphasic model suggest that spatial pressure gradients exist in static confined specimens for the majority of the loading duration. Using a parallel plate flow chamber, we report for the first time that NP cells are sensitive to fluid shear stress and confirm that lumican expression can be regulated by short durations of exposure to fluid shear.},

abstract = {Research has shown that mechanical loading affects matrix biosynthesis of intervertebral disc (IVD) cells; however, the pathway(s) to this effect is currently unknown. Cellular matrix biosynthesis is an energy demanding process. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of static and dynamic compressive loading on energy metabolism of IVD cells. Porcine annulus fibrosus (AF) and nucleus pulposus (NP) cells seeded in 2{\%} agarose were used in this experiment. Experimental groups included 15{\%} static compression and 0.1 and 1 Hz dynamic compression at 15{\%} strain magnitude for 4 h. ATP, lactate, glucose, and nitric oxide (NO) contents in culture media, and ATP content in cell-agarose construct were measured using biochemical assays. While the total ATP content of AF cells was promoted by static and dynamic loading, only 1 Hz dynamic loading increased total ATP content of NP cells. Increases in lactate production and glucose consumption of AF cells suggest that ATP production via glycolysis is promoted by dynamic compression. ATP release and NO production of AF and NP cells were significantly increased by dynamic loading. Thus, this study clearly illustrates that static and dynamic compressive loading affect IVD cell energy production while cellular responses to mechanical loading were both cell type and compression type dependent.},

abstract = {Degeneration of the intervertebral disc is characterized by changes in proteoglycan status, loss of bound water molecules, decreased tissue osmotic pressure and a resulting mechanical failure of the disc. A similar spectrum of changes is evident in osteoarthritic articular cartilage. When healthy, resident cells in these skeletal tissues respond to applied mechanical loads by regulating their own osmotic state and the hydration of the extracellular matrix. The transcription factor Tonicity-Responsive Enhancer Binding Protein (TonEBP or NFAT5) is known to mediate the osmoadaptive response in these and other tissues. While the molecular basis of how osmotic loading controls matrix homeostasis is not completely understood, TonEBP regulates the expression of aggrecan and $\beta$1,3-glucoronosyltransferase in nucleus pulposus cells, in addition to targets that allow for survival under hypertonic stress. Moreover, in chondrocytes, TonEBP controls expression of several collagen subtypes and Sox9, a master regulator of aggrecan and collagen II expression. Thus, TonEBP-mediated regulation of the matrix composition allows disc cells and chondrocytes to modify the extracellular osmotic state itself. On the other hand, TonEBP in immune cells induces expression of TNF-$\alpha$, ΙL-6 and MCP-1, pro-inflammatory molecules closely linked to matrix catabolism and pathogenesis of both disc degeneration and osteoarthritis, warranting investigations of this aspect of TonEBP function in skeletal cells. In summary, the TonEBP system, through its effects on extracellular matrix and osmoregulatory genes can be viewed primarily as a protective or homeostatic response to physiological loading.},

Bovine IVDs maintained their mechanical behavior and retained {\textgreater}85{\%} viable cells throughout the 3 week culture period.
